Research on LLM Performance Across Languages
?
??? Integrate Pairwise Evaluation
?   ??? For each exercise:
?   ?   ??? Retrieve solutions in EN, DE, and AR
?   ?   ??? Create solution pairs (EN vs. DE, EN vs. AR, DE vs. AR)
?   ?   ??? Send solution pairs to an LLM judge
?   ?   ??? Store judgment results (which solution is better?)
?   ?   ??? Analyze trends in model preference per language
?   ??? Visualize results in a heatmap
?
??? Test JudgeBench’s Hierarchical Criteria
?   ??? Define three-tiered evaluation:
?   ?   ??? Step 1: Instruction following
?   ?   ??? Step 2: Logical correctness
?   ?   ??? Step 3: Clarity and pedagogical effectiveness
?   ??? Implement an LLM judge with this criteria
?   ??? Run evaluations across EN, DE, and AR solutions
?   ??? Compare results across language-based biases
?
??? Ensure Language Fairness
?   ??? Identify if LLM solutions vary in structure, depth, or detail per language
?   ??? Normalize solution lengths to avoid verbosity bias
?   ??? Cross-translate solutions and check if meaning changes
?   ??? Randomize evaluation order to avoid positional bias
?   ??? Compare performance between different models per language
?
??? Explore Bias Studies
    ??? Check if specific LLMs perform better in their training language
    ??? Investigate common error patterns across languages
    ??? Test for numerical errors due to linguistic differences (e.g., Arabic decimal notation)
    ??? Evaluate whether models prefer one language for certain math types (word problems vs. equations)
    ??? Develop mitigation strategies if biases are found
