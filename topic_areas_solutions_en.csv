"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","A gardener needs to plant 29 flowers in rows of 3; apply the distributive property to calculate the total number of flowers he needs to plant.","To solve the task using the distributive property, let's first clarify the goal: the gardener needs to plant 29 flowers in rows of 3. Since he’s planting in rows of 3, we need to break down the total quantity of flowers (29) into groups of 3 using the distributive property.

Here’s how to apply the distributive property step by step:

1. **Set Up the Equation**: The gardener needs to figure out how many rows he can completely fill with 3 flowers and how many flowers will be left over. We can express the total number of flowers (29) as a sum that can be split into two parts.

2. **Decompose the Number**: Break down 29 into a more manageable sum. A simple breakdown could be:
   - \(29 = 27 + 2\)

   Here, 27 is a multiple of 3 (since \(27 = 3 \times 9\)) and the extra 2 represents flowers that cannot form a complete row.

3. **Apply the Distributive Property**: Now you can express the total with the distributive property:
   - \(29 = 3 \times 9 + 2\)

   This means the gardener can fill 9 full rows of 3 flowers (which is 27 flowers), and he will have 2 flowers left over.

4. **Calculate the Total**: If he plants 29 flowers in rows of 3, he can fill 9 rows fully, and the 2 remaining flowers are leftover.

5. **Final Interpretation**: The gardener needs to plant 29 flowers total. He can effectively create 9 rows of 3 flowers, and he will have 2 flowers that do not have a complete row (meaning they need to be planted but don't fit into the row scheme).

So in conclusion, using the distributive property, you calculated that the gardener can form 9 rows of 3 flowers (27 flowers) from a total of 29 flowers and has 2 remaining flowers left over. Thus, the total number of flowers he needs to plant remains 29."

3. **Calculate the Descent**: Next, the climber descends 50 meters. To find the climber's final elevation after the descent, you subtract the descent from the elevation after the ascent:
   \[
   \text{Final elevation} = 200 \text{ meters} - 50 \text{ meters} = 150 \text{ meters}
   \]

4. **Determine the Final Elevation Change**: The final elevation change from sea level is the climber's final elevation. Therefore, the final elevation change from sea level is:

Here's how you can do it step-by-step:

1. **Identify the starting and ending temperatures:**
   - Starting temperature: -5°C
   - Ending temperature: -12°C

2. **Calculate the difference:**
   The change in temperature can be calculated by subtracting the ending temperature from the starting temperature:

   \[
   \text{Temperature drop} = \text{Starting temperature} - \text{Ending temperature}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Temperature drop} = -5°C - (-12°C)
   \]

3. **Simplify the expression:**
   Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number:

   \[
   \text{Temperature drop} = -5°C + 12°C
   \]

4. **Perform the addition:**
   Now, add the two temperatures:

   \[
   -5 + 12 = 7
   \]

So, the temperature dropped by **7 degrees Celsius**."

- Eggs uses 3.

Based on this established pattern, it appears that the ingredient count matches the order in which ingredients are usually altered and incremented.

2. **Continue the Sequence**:
Following the pattern:
- The next ingredient after eggs could logically be a basic ingredient typically used in baking. A common fourth ingredient to consider is butter. 
- Therefore, you might assign it a quantity of 4 cups (the next number in the sequence).
- After butter, another ingredient commonly used in this context could be vanilla extract. Following the numerical pattern, it would fit with 5 (units of measurement being commonly in teaspoons or milliliters in smaller quantities).

### Step 1: Find the Factors of 36
Factors of a number are integers that can be multiplied together to produce that number. To find the factors of 36:

1. Start with the number 1, which is always a factor of any integer.
2. Continue checking integers up to the square root of 36. The square root of 36 is 6, so you will check the integers from 1 to 6.
3. For each integer \( n \) that divides 36 evenly (with no remainder), both \( n \) and \( \frac{36}{n} \) are factors.

Here are the checks:

- 1: \( 36 \div 1 = 36 \) (factors: 1, 36)
- 2: \( 36 \div 2 = 18 \) (factors: 2, 18)
- 3: \( 36 \div 3 = 12 \) (factors: 3, 12)
- 4: \( 36 \div 4 = 9 \) (factors: 4, 9)
- 5: \( 36 \div 5 \) does not divide evenly.
- 6: \( 36 \div 6 = 6 \) (factors: only counted once)

Now compile the factors found:
- The complete list of factors of 36: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36**.

### Step 2: Identify the Prime Factors
A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. To find which of the factors of 36 are prime:

- Look through the list of factors: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36**
- Check each number:
  - **1**: Not prime (by definition).
  - **2**: Prime (divisors are 1 and 2).
  - **3**: Prime (divisors are 1 and 3).
  - **4**: Not prime (divisors are 1, 2, 4).

"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","Calculate the first five multiples of 7 and explain the pattern you observe in those multiples.","To solve the task of calculating the first five multiples of 7, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding Multiples**: A multiple of a number is obtained by multiplying that number by an integer. In this case, you are looking for the multiples of 7.

2. **Calculate the First Five Multiples**: You calculate the first five multiples of 7 using the integers 1 through 5.

   - \( 7 \times 1 = 7 \)

   - \( 7 \times 5 = 35 \)

   So, the first five multiples of 7 are: **7, 14, 21, 28,** and **35**.

3. **Observe the Pattern**: Now that you have the multiples, you can look for patterns among them. Here are a few observations:

   - **Increment Pattern**: Each multiple of 7 is the previous multiple plus 7. For example:
     - \( 14 - 7 = 7 \)
     - \( 21 - 14 = 7 \)
     - \( 28 - 21 = 7 \)
     - \( 35 - 28 = 7 \)
   - **Even and Odd**: The multiples alternate between odd and even numbers. Specifically, the first multiple (7) is odd, the second (14) is even, the third (21) is odd, the fourth (28) is even, and the fifth (35) is odd.
   - **Last Digit Pattern**: The last digit of the multiples follows a pattern based on those derived from 7:
     - 7: last digit is 7
     - 14: last digit is 4
     - 21: last digit is 1
     - 28: last digit is 8
     - 35: last digit is 5

Here are two common methods to find the GCD:

### Method 1: Prime Factorization

1. **Find the prime factorization** of each number.
   - For 20: 
     - 20 = 2 × 10
     - 10 = 2 × 5 
     - So, the prime factorization of 20 is \(2^2 \times 5\).
   - For 30: 
     - 30 = 2 × 15
     - 15 = 3 × 5 
     - So, the prime factorization of 30 is \(2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1\).

2. **Identify the common prime factors**.
   - The common prime factors from the factorizations of 20 and 30 are 2 and 5.

3. **Take the lowest power of each common prime factor**:
   - For 2, the lowest power is \(2^1\) (from 30).
   - For 5, the lowest power is \(5^1\) (common to both).

4. **Multiply these together**:
   - GCD = \(2^1 \times 5^1 = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

### Method 2: Euclidean Algorithm

1. **Use the Euclidean algorithm**:
   - Start with the two numbers: 30 and 20. 
   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder: 
     - \(30 \div 20 = 1\) remainder \(10\) (since \(30 - 20 = 10\)).
   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller with the remainder: now you have 20 and 10.

2. **Repeat the process**:
   - Divide 20 by 10:
     - \(20 \div 10 = 2\) with a remainder of \(0\) (since \(20 - 2 \times 10 = 0\)).
   - When the remainder is 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Here, the last non-zero remainder is 10.

### Final Result
Using either method, you find that the GCD of 20 and 30 is **10**. This means that the largest shared factor of 20 and 30 is 10."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","A gardener wants to plant flowers in rows using 18 red flowers and 24 blue flowers; what is the LCM of 18 and 24 to find the smallest number of total flowers he can use without having leftovers?","To solve the task of finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 24, you want to determine the smallest number of flowers the gardener can plant in rows without having any leftover flowers of either color. Here's how you can do that step-by-step:

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number:
- **For 18**: 
  - \( 18 = 2 \times 9 = 2 \times 3^2 \)
- **For 24**: 
  - \( 24 = 2^3 \times 3 \)

### Step 2: Identify the Highest Powers
Next, identify the highest powers of each prime factor present in both factorizations:
- The prime factors we have are 2 and 3.
- For **2**: The highest power is \( 2^3 \) (from 24).
- For **3**: The highest power is \( 3^2 \) (from 18).

### Step 3: Calculate the LCM
Now, multiply these highest powers together to find the LCM:
- LCM = \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \) and \( 3^2 = 9 \)
- Thus, \( 8 \times 9 = 72 \)

### Step 4: Conclusion
The LCM of 18 and 24 is 72. This means the smallest number of total flowers the gardener can use, while ensuring that he does not have any leftover flowers when planting them in rows, is **72** flowers.

### Verification
Finally, you can check that both 18 and 24 divide 72 evenly:
- \( 72 \div 18 = 4 \) (no leftover)
- \( 72 \div 24 = 3 \) (no leftover)

So, the gardener can plant 72 flowers in total without any leftovers, using all 18 red and all 24 blue flowers in rows."

"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","F","If the area of a square garden is 81 square feet find the length of one side of the garden.","To find the length of one side of a square garden when you know the area, you can use the formula for the area of a square:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length} \times \text{side length} = \text{side length}^2
\]

In your case, the area of the square garden is given as 81 square feet. Let's denote the length of one side of the garden as \( s \).

So, based on the formula, you can set up the equation:

\[
s^2 = 81
\]

To find the value of \( s \) (the side length), you'll want to take the square root of both sides of the equation:

\[
s = \sqrt{81}
\]

- The new coordinates after a 90-degree clockwise rotation are given by the formula:
  \[
  (x', y') = (y, -x)
  \]

Where \( (x, y) \) are the original coordinates, and \( (x', y') \) are the new coordinates after the rotation.

Now, let's apply this formula to each vertex of the triangle:

1. **Vertex A(2, 3)**:
   \[
   A' = (y, -x) = (3, -2)
   \]

2. **Vertex B(4, 5)**:

Now we can state the new coordinates of the vertices after the rotation:

- A' = (3, -2)
- B' = (5, -4)
- C' = (1, -3)

So the new coordinates of the vertices after rotating the triangle 90 degrees clockwise around the origin are:

Let's break this down step-by-step with the corners of the rectangle provided:

1. **Identify the coordinates of the corners:**
   - D(-1, -2)
   - E(-1, 2)
   - F(3, 2)
   - G(3, -2)

2. **Apply the reflection across the y-axis:**
   - For a point \((x, y)\), the reflected point will be \((-x, y)\).
   
3. **Calculate the reflected coordinates:**
   - Reflecting point D(-1, -2):
     \[

### Step 1: Understand the rotation
Rotating a point \( (x, y) \) around another point \( (h, k) \) by an angle \( \theta \) can be done using formulas for the rotated coordinates \( (x', y') \). For a 180-degree rotation, the coordinates of the point after rotation can be calculated using:

\[
x' = h + (x - h) \cos(180^\circ) - (y - k) \sin(180^\circ)
\]
\[
y' = k + (x - h) \sin(180^\circ) + (y - k) \cos(180^\circ)
\]

Since:
- \( \cos(180^\circ) = -1 \)
- \( \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \)

The formulas simplify to:

\[
x' = h - (x - h) = 2h - x
\]
\[
y' = k - (y - k) = 2k - y
\]

### Step 2: Apply the formulas for each vertex
Now we will apply these formulas to each vertex of the square.

**Vertex H(1, 1):**
- \( h = 3, k = 3, x = 1, y = 1 \)

\[
x' = 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
\]
\[
y' = 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
\]
So, \( H' = (5, 5) \).

**Vertex I(1, 5):**
- \( x = 1, y = 5 \)
  
\[
x' = 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
\]
\[
y' = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1
\]
So, \( I' = (5, 1) \).

**Vertex J(5, 5):**
- \( x = 5, y = 5 \)

\[
x' = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1
\]
\[
y' = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1
\]
So, \( J' = (1, 1) \).

**Vertex K(5, 1):**
- \( x = 5, y = 1 \)

\[
x' = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1
\]
\[
y' = 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
\]
So, \( K' = (1, 5) \).

### Step 3: Summarize the new coordinates
After performing the calculations, we find the new positions of the vertices after the 180-degree rotation around point (3, 3):

- \( H'(5, 5) \)
- \( I'(5, 1) \)
- \( J'(1, 1) \)
- \( K'(1, 5) \)

### Final Output
Thus, the coordinates of the new positions of the vertices after rotation are:
- \( H' = (5, 5) \)
- \( I' = (5, 1) \)
- \( J' = (1, 1) \)
- \( K' = (1, 5) \)"

In your case, you want to translate the triangle 2 units to the left and 3 units down.

Here's how to do that step-by-step:

1. **Identify the original vertices**: The triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (4, 5), and (3, 7).

2. **Apply the translation**:
   - **Translate 2 units left**: To move left, you subtract 2 from each x-coordinate.
   - **Translate 3 units down**: To move down, you subtract 3 from each y-coordinate.

3. **Calculate the new coordinates for each vertex**:
   - For the vertex (2, 3):
     - New x-coordinate: \(2 - 2 = 0\)
     - New y-coordinate: \(3 - 3 = 0\)
     - New vertex: (0, 0)

   - For the vertex (4, 5):
     - New x-coordinate: \(4 - 2 = 2\)
     - New y-coordinate: \(5 - 3 = 2\)
     - New vertex: (2, 2)

   - For the vertex (3, 7):
     - New x-coordinate: \(3 - 2 = 1\)
     - New y-coordinate: \(7 - 3 = 4\)
     - New vertex: (1, 4)

4. **List the new vertices**: After performing the translations, the new vertices of the triangle are:
   - (0, 0)

   - For (1, 4): The reflected point is \((-1, 4)\)
   - For (4, 1): The reflected point is \((-4, 1)\)
   - For (4, 4): The reflected point is \((-4, 4)\)

1. **Identify the vertices of the quadrilateral**: 
   The vertices are located at the points \( (5, 2) \), \( (5, 6) \), \( (8, 2) \), and \( (8, 6) \).

2. **Understand the translation**: 
   A translation is a type of transformation that shifts all points of a shape by the same amount in the horizontal and vertical directions. In this case, you need to translate the quadrilateral 3 units to the right and 2 units up.

3. **Apply the translation to each vertex**: 
   - Translating right by 3 units means you add 3 to the x-coordinate of each vertex.
   - Translating up by 2 units means you add 2 to the y-coordinate of each vertex.
   
   You can apply the translation to each vertex as follows:
   
   - **Vertex (5, 2)**: 
     \[
     (5 + 3, 2 + 2) = (8, 4)
     \]
   - **Vertex (5, 6)**:

     \]
   - **Vertex (8, 6)**: 
     \[
     (8 + 3, 6 + 2) = (11, 8)
     \]

4. **List the new vertices**: 
   After the translation, the new vertices of the quadrilateral will be:
   - \( (8, 4) \)
   - \( (8, 8) \)
   - \( (11, 4) \)
   - \( (11, 8) \)

5. **Sketch the resulting figure**: 
   - To sketch the quadrilateral, start by plotting the new vertices on a graph:
     - Plot \( (8, 4) \)
     - Plot \( (8, 8) \)
     - Plot \( (11, 4) \)
     - Plot \( (11, 8) \)
   - Connect the vertices in the correct order to form the shape of the quadrilateral. The connections will create a rectangle since the original quadrilateral was also a rectangle.

6. **Label the vertices on your sketch**: 
   Don’t forget to label the new vertices \( (8, 4) \), \( (8, 8) \), \( (11, 4) \), and \( (11, 8) \) on your sketch.

1. **Draw the Rectangle:**
   - Start by drawing a straight horizontal line. This will be the top side of the rectangle.
   - At each end of this line, draw two vertical lines going downward of equal length. These will be the two sides of the rectangle.
   - Connect the ends of the vertical lines with another straight horizontal line to complete the rectangle at the bottom.

2. **Label the Four Sides:**

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","C","Sketch a triangle with different side lengths and mark its three angles as acute right or obtuse.","To sketch a triangle with different side lengths and mark its angles as acute, right, or obtuse, you can follow these steps:

1. **Choose the Side Lengths**: Select three different lengths for your triangle sides. For example, you might choose lengths of 4 cm, 5 cm, and 7 cm. Ensure that the chosen lengths satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

2. **Sketch the Triangle**:
   - Start by drawing the longest side, which is 7 cm in this example, horizontally on your paper.
   - Then, from one endpoint of this side (let's call it A), use a compass to measure 4 cm and mark a point (B).
   - Next, from the other endpoint of the longest side (C), use the compass to measure 5 cm and mark a point that intersects the circle you drew from point A. Name this point D. 

   The points A, B, and C will form your triangle. 

3. **Label the Angles**: 
   - The triangle has three angles: ∠ABC, ∠BCA, and ∠CAB.
   - To determine whether each angle is acute (less than 90°), right (exactly 90°), or obtuse (greater than 90°), you can:
     - Use the relationships between the sides (e.g., in a triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c opposite angles A, B, and C respectively, if \( c^2 > a^2 + b^2 \), then angle C is obtuse; if \( c^2 < a^2 + b^2 \), then angle C is acute; and if \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \), then angle C is right).
   - For the lengths chosen (4 cm, 5 cm, and 7 cm), you can calculate:
     - Let’s say you have a triangle that clearly appears to have one of the angles greater than 90°, you can label that angle as obtuse.
     - For example, if angle ∠CAB looks like it may be greater than 90°, label it as obtuse. The remaining angles would then be marked as acute if they are under 90°.

4. **Final Touches**:
   - Clearly label the vertices of the triangle (A, B, C) and the respective angles (∠ABC, ∠BCA, ∠CAB).
   - Indicate the type of each angle: you might use a small circle in the corner of an acute angle, a square in the corner of a right angle, or an arc for an obtuse angle.

1. Graph paper or plain paper
2. A ruler
3. A pencil
4. A protractor (optional, for verifying right angles)

### Steps to Create a Square

1. **Draw the Square**:
   - Start by deciding on the length of one side of the square. For example, let's say each side will be 4 units long.
   - Using your ruler, draw the first side. Draw a horizontal line that is 4 units long.
   - Mark the endpoints of this line as point A (the left endpoint) and point B (the right endpoint).

2. **Construct the Remaining Sides**:
   - From point A, use your ruler to draw a vertical line straight up measuring 4 units. Mark the top endpoint as point C.
   - From point B, draw another vertical line straight up, also measuring 4 units, and mark this endpoint as point D.
   - Connect point C and point D with a horizontal line, ensuring it is 4 units long. This completes the square.

3. **Label the Square**:
   - Label the vertices of the square:
     - A (bottom left)
     - B (bottom right)
     - C (top left)
     - D (top right)
   - You should now have the square labeled as ABCD.

4. **Identify and Label the Sides**:
   - Label each of the four sides:
     - Side AB (bottom side)
     - Side BC (right side)
     - Side CD (top side)
     - Side DA (left side)
   - You can write these labels along the corresponding sides or place them nearby.

5. **Identify and Label the Right Angles**:
   - At each of the corners (points A, B, C, and D), you have right angles (90 degrees).
   - You can label these angles as follows:
     - Angle A (between sides DA and AB)
     - Angle B (between sides AB and BC)
     - Angle C (between sides BC and CD)
     - Angle D (between sides CD and DA)
   - Optionally, you can draw a small square symbol (or arc) in each corner to indicate that these are right angles.

   - Choose one corner to create the right angle. Let’s say you choose the bottom left corner (corner A).
   - From corner A, draw a vertical line upwards (along the side of the square) for a short distance. 
   - Then, from the end of this vertical line, draw a horizontal line to the right. 
   - This horizontal line should be perpendicular to the vertical line you've just drawn, forming the two sides of your right angle.

4. **Label the Right Angle**:
   - Near the right angle you have formed, write ""Right Angle"" clearly. You can place the label inside the right angle area or just next to it, based on your preference.
   - It's also a good idea to draw a small square in the corner where the two lines meet to indicate that it's a right angle, if you want to emphasize it.

5. **Finalize Your Drawing**:
   - Go over your lines with a pen if you want to make them stand out.
   - Erase any unnecessary pencil marks to clean up your drawing.

### Result:
You should now have a square with a clearly marked right angle at one of its corners, labeled as ""Right Angle"".

### Tips: 
- Make sure the lines that form the right angle are straight and clean for clarity.
- If you're unsure about the angle being exactly 90 degrees, you can use a protractor or ensure that the lines are perpendicular using a ruler.
- Practice if needed until you feel comfortable with the drawing."
"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","C","In the triangle provided identify one acute angle and shade it then label it as ""Acute Angle.""","To solve the task of identifying and shading an acute angle in a triangle, follow these steps:

1. **Understand Acute Angles**: An acute angle is any angle that measures less than 90 degrees. In a triangle, the angles are often labeled or can be visually estimated.

2. **Examine the Triangle**: Look closely at the angles formed at each vertex of the triangle. You can either rely on your understanding of visually estimating angles or measure them if you have tools available (protractor or angle measuring app).

3. **Identify an Acute Angle**: Once you determine which angles in the triangle are less than 90 degrees, choose one of those angles to work with. 

4. **Shade the Angle**: Use a pencil, pen, or digital tool to shade the selected acute angle. This often means coloring in the area between the sides of the angle.

5. **Label the Angle**: Near the shaded region, write “Acute Angle” to clearly indicate what you have shaded.

6. **Double-Check**: Ensure the angle you shaded is indeed acute and that your label is clear and legible.

Once you’ve completed these steps, you will have successfully identified, shaded, and labeled an acute angle in your triangle."
"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","C","Using a ruler create a shape that includes at least two right angles and one acute angle then label each angle accordingly.","To create a shape with at least two right angles and one acute angle using a ruler, follow these steps:

### Materials Needed:
- Ruler
- Pencil
- Eraser (optional)

### Steps to Create the Shape:

1. **Draw the First Side:**
   - Use the ruler to draw a straight line segment. Let's say you draw a horizontal line from point A to point B.

2. **Create the First Right Angle:**
   - From point B, use the ruler to draw a vertical line downwards (this is the second side). You can use a protractor or simply ensure that the line is perpendicular to AB to create a right angle at point B. Label this angle as **Angle ABC**.

3. **Create the Second Right Angle:**
   - From point A, draw a vertical line upwards (this will be the third side of your shape) that is parallel to the line you drew from B. Label the intersection of this new line with the vertical line from B as point C. This creates another right angle at point A (also labeled **Angle ABC**).

4. **Create an Acute Angle:**
   - To form an acute angle, extend the vertical line from point C (the third side) to the right. Let's say you extend it to point D. This will form an acute angle where line segment CD meets line segment BC. Label this angle **Angle BCD**.

5. **Finalize the Shape:**
   - You now have a shape that consists of segments AB, BC, and CD. The figure should look somewhat like an ""L"" with an additional segment going to the right creating the acute angle.

### Label Each Angle:
- Angle ABC (Right Angle)
- Angle A (Right Angle)
- Angle BCD (Acute Angle)

### Visual Representation After Following the Steps:

- **Angle A** and **Angle B** are your right angles.
- **Angle BCD** is your acute angle, as it is less than 90 degrees.

### Summary:
By carefully drawing straight lines with a ruler to ensure right angles and strategically adding a third line to create an acute angle, you can create the required shape. Be sure to label each angle as specified."
"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","E","Draw a line segment AB that measures 8 cm and accurately mark its midpoint M.","To draw a line segment AB measuring 8 cm and accurately mark its midpoint M, follow these steps:

### Materials Needed:
- A ruler
- A pencil
- A compass (optional for marking the midpoint)

### Steps to Follow:

1. **Drawing the Line Segment AB**:
    - Take your ruler and place it on your drawing surface (paper, etc.).
    - Position the ruler so that one end is at a point you will label as point A.
    - From point A, measure 8 cm along the ruler and make a small mark. 
    - Label the end of this 8 cm measurement as point B.
    - Use your pencil to draw a straight line connecting point A and point B.

2. **Finding and Marking the Midpoint M**:
    - Since the length of segment AB is 8 cm, the midpoint will be located exactly halfway between A and B, which is at 4 cm from either end.
    - You can measure 4 cm from point A along the line segment towards point B and make a small mark. Label this point as M.
    - Alternatively, if you want to ensure accuracy, you can use a compass:
        - Place the compass point on A, and adjust the compass width to reach point B (8 cm).
        - Draw arcs above and below the line segment from points A and B without changing the compass width. 
        - The two arcs will intersect at two points. Draw a straight line through these intersection points to cross line segment AB. This line will intersect at the midpoint M.

### Final Touch:
- Make sure that point M is clearly marked, perhaps using a small dot or circle around it, to indicate that it's the midpoint.

By following these steps, you will have accurately drawn a line segment AB that measures 8 cm and successfully marked its midpoint M."

### Materials Needed:
- A straightedge (ruler without measurement markings)
- A compass
- A pencil
- A piece of paper

### Steps to Construct the Perpendicular Bisector:

1. **Draw Segment CD**:
   - Use a straightedge to draw a line segment \( CD \) that is exactly 10 cm long. Label the endpoints \( C \) and \( D \).

2. **Locate the Midpoint**:
   - Set the compass to a width greater than half the length of \( CD \) (more than 5 cm is sufficient).
   - With the compass point on \( C \), draw an arc above and below the line segment.
   - Without changing the compass width, place the compass point on \( D \) and draw another arc above and below the line segment, intersecting the arcs from step 2.

3. **Marking Intersection Points**:
   - Label the points where the arcs intersect as \( A \) (above the segment) and \( B \) (below the segment). Adjust your arcs if necessary to ensure that they intersect.

4. **Draw the Perpendicular Bisector**:
   - Use the straightedge to connect points \( A \) and \( B \). This line will be the perpendicular bisector of segment \( CD \).
   - The perpendicular bisector will intersect segment \( CD \) exactly at its midpoint.

5. **Label the Midpoint**:
   - If desired, you can label the midpoint of segment \( CD \) (the point of intersection of the bisector and segment \( CD \)) as \( M \).

### Final Result:
- You now have a perpendicular bisector of line segment \( CD \). The intersection point where the bisector intersects \( CD \) can be labeled \( M \).

### Recap:
1. Draw segment \( CD \).
2. Draw arcs from \( C \) and \( D \) to find points \( A \) and \( B \).
3. Connect \( A \) and \( B \) with a straightedge to form the perpendicular bisector.
4. Label points \( C, D, A, B, \) and \( M \) appropriately.

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","E","Create two points E and F on a piece of paper measure the distance between them and then find and draw the bisector of segment EF labeling the midpoint N.","To accomplish the task, follow these steps:

### Materials Needed
- A ruler
- A pencil 
- A piece of paper
- A compass (optional for drawing circles)

### Steps to Solve the Task

1. **Create Points E and F:**
   - On your piece of paper, randomly choose a spot to place point E. You can mark this with a dot and label it ""E.""
   - Choose another spot on the paper for point F, ensuring it's not too close to point E. Mark this with a dot and label it ""F.""

2. **Measure the Distance Between E and F:**
   - Using the ruler, measure the distance between the two points E and F. This is done by placing the zero mark of the ruler at point E and noting where point F falls on the ruler. You can write down this measurement for reference, though it’s optional for the rest of the task.

3. **Find the Midpoint N:**
   - The midpoint N is the point that is directly in between points E and F.
   - To find midpoint N, you can use the formula:
     \[
     N_x = \frac{E_x + F_x}{2}
     \]
     \[
     N_y = \frac{E_y + F_y}{2}
     \]
     (where \(E_x\) and \(E_y\) are the coordinates of point E and \(F_x\) and \(F_y\) are the coordinates of point F).
   - Alternately, you could visually estimate the midpoint by measuring the distance between E and F and dividing that distance in half. You can also use the ruler to measure half the distance and then mark that point as N.

4. **Draw the Bisector of Segment EF:**
   - To draw the bisector, you have a couple of options:
     - **Using a Compass:**
       - Place the compass point on E and draw an arc above and below the line EF.
       - Without changing the width of the compass, place the compass point on F and draw another arc that intersects the first two arcs.
       - Label the intersection points as G and H.
       - Using your ruler, draw a straight line connecting points G and H. This line is the perpendicular bisector of segment EF.
     - **Without a Compass:**
       - Simply draw a straight line from E to F, then visualize or lightly sketch a straight line through point N that is 90 degrees (perpendicular) to EF.
  
5. **Label the Diagram:**
   - Make sure to clearly label:
     - Points E and F
     - The midpoint N
     - The bisector line you drew.

### Final Touches
- You can darken the lines you want to keep and erase any unnecessary marks.
- Highlighting any important points or lines will help in distinguishing them.

Once you’ve done all these steps, you will have successfully created points E and F, measured the distance between them, marked their midpoint N, and drawn the bisector of segment EF."

### Step 1: Set Up Your Grid
1. Draw a Cartesian plane with an x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical). Make sure both axes are labeled with numbers, allowing you to plot coordinates easily. You can use either graph paper or a drawing application.

### Step 2: Plot the Points
2. Plot the given coordinates on your grid:
   - **Point A**: Locate (2, 3). Move right to 2 on the x-axis, and then up to 3 on the y-axis. Mark point A.
   - **Point B**: Locate (5, 5). Move right to 5 on the x-axis and up to 5 on the y-axis. Mark point B.
   - **Point C**: Locate (4, 1). Move right to 4 on the x-axis and down to 1 on the y-axis. Mark point C.
   - **Point D**: Locate (1, 2). Move right to 1 on the x-axis and up to 2 on the y-axis. Mark point D.

### Step 3: Connect the Points to Form a Polygon
3. After plotting the points, connect them in the order given (A to B, B to C, C to D, and then D back to A) using straight lines with a ruler. 

### Step 4: Name the Polygon
4. After connecting the points, observe the shape you’ve formed:
   - The polygon you created has four sides and four vertices (A, B, C, D).
   - A polygon with four sides is known as a **quadrilateral**.

### Step 5: Label the Polygon
5. Finally, you can label the formed shape as a ""Quadrilateral ABCD"".

### Additional Note
- To identify more specific names for the quadrilateral (like rectangle, square, trapezoid, etc.), you would need to calculate the lengths of the sides and the angles between them, which are not required for this basic task.

That's it! You have successfully plotted the points, connected them to form a polygon, and identified its name as a quadrilateral."
"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","E","Using the coordinates E(3 4) F(6 7) G(5 3) and H(2 1) plot the points on a grid and determine if the figure formed is a quadrilateral or a triangle.","To solve the task of plotting the given points and determining whether they form a quadrilateral or a triangle, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Plot the Points on a Grid

1. **Draw a Coordinate Plane**: Create a grid with an x-axis (horizontal) and a y-axis (vertical). Make sure to label the axes and include a scale (for example, each grid square can represent one unit).

2. **Plot Each Point**:
   - For point E(3, 4): Start at the origin (0, 0). Move 3 units to the right (along the x-axis) and 4 units up (along the y-axis). Mark this point and label it E.
   - For point F(6, 7): From the origin, move 6 units to the right and 7 units up. Mark this point and label it F.
   - For point G(5, 3): Move 5 units to the right and 3 units up from the origin. Mark and label this point G.
   - For point H(2, 1): Move 2 units to the right and 1 unit up from the origin. Mark and label this point H.

### Step 2: Connect the Points

3. **Draw Line Segments**: Use a ruler to connect the points:
   - Connect E to F.
   - Connect F to G.
   - Connect G to H.
   - Connect H back to E.

### Step 3: Determine the Figure Formed

4. **Count the Points**: You have plotted four points: E, F, G, and H.

5. **Figure Type**: 
   - If all four points are plotted and joined, you have a closed figure with four sides, which is classified as a **quadrilateral**.
   - If only three points were connected and the fourth point was not included, then that would form a **triangle**. 

### Conclusion

Since you have four distinct points and all of them are connected, you conclude that the figure formed is a **quadrilateral**.

### Additional Notes

- You could also check if any three points are collinear (lying on a straight line), which would confirm that they don't form a closed shape. You can do this using slope calculations or by observing the plotted graph. However, in the case of four non-collinear points, you simply confirm a quadrilateral unless specified otherwise by missing connections."

### Step 1: Draw the Coordinate Grid
1. **Create the Axes**: Draw two perpendicular lines: a horizontal line (x-axis) and a vertical line (y-axis) that intersect at the origin point (0, 0).
2. **Label the Axes**: Mark the x-axis with numbers progressing to the right (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) and the y-axis with numbers progressing upward (1, 2, 3, 4, ...).
3. **Scale the Axes**: Ensure the distance between each unit is equal for proportional representation.

### Step 2: Plot the Points
1. **Plot Point J(1, 1)**: Start at the origin (0, 0). Move 1 unit to the right (along the x-axis) and 1 unit up (along the y-axis) and mark point J.
2. **Plot Point K(4, 1)**: From the origin, move 4 units to the right and 1 unit up. Mark point K.
3. **Plot Point L(4, 4)**: From the origin, move 4 units to the right and 4 units up. Mark point L.
4. **Plot Point M(1, 4)**: From the origin, move 1 unit to the right and 4 units up. Mark point M.

### Step 3: Connect the Points
- Draw straight lines to connect the points J to K, K to L, L to M, and M back to J. This will form a closed shape.

### Step 4: Describe the Shape
The points J, K, L, and M form a quadrilateral. More specifically:
- J(1, 1) to K(4, 1) is a horizontal line.
- K(4, 1) to L(4, 4) is a vertical line.
- L(4, 4) to M(1, 4) is another horizontal line.
- M(1, 4) to J(1, 1) is a vertical line.
This shape is a rectangle because opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees.

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter
To find the perimeter of the rectangle, use the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

1. **Calculate Length and Width**:
   - Length (distance between K and L) = 4 - 1 = 3 units (along the y-axis from y = 1 to y = 4)
   - Width (distance between J and K) = 4 - 1 = 3 units (along the x-axis from x = 1 to x = 4)

2. **Substitute into the formula**:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (3 + 3) = 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ units} \]

### Final Results
- **Shape**: Rectangle
- **Perimeter**: 12 units

Here's how you can do that step by step:

### Step 1: Find the equation of line AB
1. **Identify the coordinates**: A(2, 3) and B(5, 7).
2. **Calculate the slope (m)** using the formula \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \):
   \[
   m_{AB} = \frac{7 - 3}{5 - 2} = \frac{4}{3}
   \]
3. **Use the point-slope form of the line equation**, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \):
   Using point A(2, 3):
   \[
   y - 3 = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2)
   \]
4. **Convert to slope-intercept form (y = mx + b)**:
   \[
   y - 3 = \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{8}{3}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{8}{3} + 3
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{4}{3}x + \frac{1}{3}
   \]
The equation of line AB is:
\[
y = \frac{4}{3}x + \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Step 2: Find the equation of line BC
1. **Identify the coordinates**: B(5, 7) and C(4, 1).
2. **Calculate the slope (m)**:
   \[
   m_{BC} = \frac{1 - 7}{4 - 5} = \frac{-6}{-1} = 6
   \]
3. **Use the point-slope form using point B(5, 7)**:
   \[
   y - 7 = 6(x - 5)
   \]
4. **Convert to slope-intercept form**:
   \[
   y - 7 = 6x - 30
   \]
   \[
   y = 6x - 30 + 7
   \]
   \[
   y = 6x - 23
   \]
The equation of line BC is:
\[
y = 6x - 23
\]

### Step 3: Find the equation of line CA
1. **Identify the coordinates**: C(4, 1) and A(2, 3).
2. **Calculate the slope (m)**:
   \[
   m_{CA} = \frac{3 - 1}{2 - 4} = \frac{2}{-2} = -1
   \]
3. **Use the point-slope form using point C(4, 1)**:
   \[
   y - 1 = -1(x - 4)
   \]
4. **Convert to slope-intercept form**:
   \[
   y - 1 = -x + 4
   \]
   \[
   y = -x + 5
   \]
The equation of line CA is:
\[
y = -x + 5
\]

### Summary of the Equations
1. Line AB: \( y = \frac{4}{3}x + \frac{1}{3} \)
2. Line BC: \( y = 6x - 23 \)
3. Line CA: \( y = -x + 5 \)

### Step 1: Identify the vertices
The vertices provided are:
1. \(A(-1, -2)\)
2. \(B(-1, 2)\)
3. \(C(3, 2)\)
4. \(D(3, -2)\)

### Step 2: Determine the sides of the rectangle
The sides of the rectangle can be determined by analyzing the connections between the vertices:
- Side \(AB\) connects points \(A\) and \(B\)
- Side \(BC\) connects points \(B\) and \(C\)
- Side \(CD\) connects points \(C\) and \(D\)
- Side \(DA\) connects points \(D\) and \(A\)

### Step 3: Find the equations for each side
To find the equations of each side, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line:

#### Side \(CD\):
- Points: \((3, 2)\) and \((3, -2)\)
- This is also a vertical line, hence the equation is:
\[
x = 3
\]

#### Side \(DA\):
- Points: \((3, -2)\) and \((-1, -2)\)
- This line is also horizontal, so the equation is:
\[
y = -2

2. **Determine pairs of adjacent vertices**: Since it’s a hexagon, each vertex connects to the next, and the last vertex connects back to the first vertex. The pairs of adjacent vertices are:
   - \( A \) and \( B \)
   - \( B \) and \( C \)
   - \( C \) and \( D \)
   - \( D \) and \( E \)
   - \( E \) and \( F \)
   - \( F \) and \( A \)

3. **Find the slope of each line segment**: The slope \( m \) of a line connecting two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}

- Points \( A(1, 1) \) and \( B(3, 2) \):
  \[
  m = \frac{2 - 1}{3 - 1} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
  Using point-slope form from point \( A \):
  \[
  y - 1 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 1) \implies y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}
  \]

### 2. Line segment \( BC \)
- Points \( B(3, 2) \) and \( C(4, 0) \):
  \[
  m = \frac{0 - 2}{4 - 3} = -2

### 4. Line segment \( DE \)
- Points \( D(3, -2) \) and \( E(1, -1) \):
  \[
  m = \frac{-1 - (-2)}{1 - 3} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}
  \]
  Using point-slope form from point \( D \):
  \[
  y + 2 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 3) \implies y = -\frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{2}
  \]

### 5. Line segment \( EF \)
- Points \( E(1, -1) \) and \( F(0, 0) \):
  \[
  m = \frac{0 - (-1)}{0 - 1} = -1

Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you complete the task:

### Materials Needed
- Compass
- Straightedge (ruler without markings)
- Pencil
- Paper

### Steps

1. **Draw the Base:**
   - Using the straightedge, draw a line segment that measures 8 cm. Label the endpoints of this line segment as \(A\) and \(B\). This will be one side of your equilateral triangle.

2. **Construct the Arc for the Third Vertex:**
   - Place the compass point on point \(A\), and set the compass width to 8 cm (the length of side \(AB\)). 
   - Draw an arc above the line segment \(AB\). 

3. **Construct Another Arc:**
   - Without altering the compass width, place the compass point on point \(B\).
   - Draw another arc above the line segment \(AB\). 

4. **Locate the Third Vertex:**
   - The two arcs you just drew will intersect at one point above line segment \(AB\). Label this intersection as point \(C\).

5. **Complete the Triangle:**
   - Use the straightedge to draw line segments from point \(C\) to point \(A\) and from point \(C\) to point \(B\). Now you have triangle \(ABC\).

6. **Verify the Triangle:**
   - To ensure that triangle \(ABC\) is equilateral, you can measure each side (\(AB\), \(BC\), and \(CA\)) using a ruler to confirm they are all 8 cm.

### Summary
You have now successfully constructed an equilateral triangle with each side measuring 8 cm using only a compass and straightedge. The intersection of the arcs guarantees that all sides are equal, thereby maintaining the equilateral property."

### Step 1: Draw the Circle
1. **Locate Point A**: Use your compass to mark Point A on your paper.
2. **Set the Compass Radius**: Open your compass to a width of 5 cm.
3. **Draw the Circle**: Place the compass point on Point A and rotate the compass 360 degrees to draw a circle.

### Step 2: Mark Point B on the Circle
4. **Choose Point B**: Select any point on the circumference of the circle. Label this point B.

### Step 3: Draw the Radius to Point B
5. **Draw Line AB**: Use your straightedge to draw a line from Point A (the center) to Point B (on the circumference). This line represents the radius of the circle.

### Step 4: Construct the Tangent Line
6. **Construct a Perpendicular Line**: The tangent line at point B is perpendicular to line AB at point B.
   - **Using the Compass**: 
     - Place the compass point on Point B and draw an arc that intersects the line AB on both sides of Point B. Call those intersection points C and D.
     - Keeping the same compass width, place the compass point on point C and draw an arc above the line. Without changing the compass width, place the compass point on point D and draw another arc intersecting the first one (above line AB). Mark this intersection point as E.
   - **Draw Line BE**: Use the straightedge to draw a line from Point B to the point E. This line BE is perpendicular to line AB.

### Step 5: Extend the Tangent Line
7. **Extend Line BE**: Continue the line BE in both directions to create the tangent line that touches the circle only at point B.

### Final Outcome
You now have a circle with a radius of 5 cm centered at point A and a tangent line that touches the circle at point B. 

### Additional Tips
- Ensure your compass and straightedge are used carefully to maintain accuracy.
- The tangent line should only touch the circle at point B and not cross it.
- Practice these steps a few times for proficiency. 

This method employs basic principles of geometry and construction with a straightedge and compass!"

### Materials Needed:
- Protractor
- Ruler
- Pencil
- Paper

### Steps to Create the Triangle:

1. **Draw the Hypotenuse:**
   - Use your ruler to draw a horizontal line segment that is 10 cm long. Label the endpoints as points **A** and **B**. This line segment (AB) will represent the hypotenuse of the triangle.

2. **Locate the Vertex of the Right Angle:**
   - Find the midpoint of the line segment AB. You can do this by measuring 5 cm from either point A or point B. Mark this midpoint as point **C**.

3. **Create the 45-degree Angles:**
   - Place the center point of your protractor at point C, ensuring that the baseline of the protractor aligns with line segment AB.
   - Measure 45 degrees from the baseline (line AB) toward the inside of the triangle and make a small mark on the paper. This will represent one of the other points of the triangle, label it as point **D**.

4. **Complete the Right Triangle:**
   - Use your ruler to draw a line segment from point C to point D (CD).
   - Now, to complete the right triangle, you need to draw another line segment from point D to point A. Label this new segment as line segment AD.

5. **Label the Sides and Angles:**
   - The triangle can now be labeled with the following:
     - **Angle A (∠CAB)** = 45 degrees
     - **Angle B (∠ABC)** = 90 degrees (since it is a right triangle)
     - **Angle C (∠BCA)** = 45 degrees (since the angles in a triangle sum up to 180 degrees and the two non-right angles are equal in a 45-45-90 triangle)
     - The lengths of sides:
       - **Side AB (hypotenuse)** = 10 cm
       - **Sides AC and BC** can be calculated using the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle, where both sides are equal and can be calculated as:
         \[
         AC = BC = \frac{AB}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 7.07 \text{ cm}
         \]

6. **Finalize the Triangle:**
   - Make sure all points, angles, and side lengths are clearly labeled on your triangle for easy reference.

### Summary:

1. **Define the Shape**: A hexagon is a polygon with six sides.

2. **Count the Angles in a Hexagon**: 
   - For any polygon, the number of angles is equal to the number of sides. Therefore, since a hexagon has 6 sides, it also has 6 angles.

3. **Understand Equiangular vs. Non-equiangular Shapes**:
   - A polygon is classified as **equiangular** if all of its interior angles are equal. 
   - Conversely, it is classified as **non-equiangular** if at least one angle is different from the others.

4. **Determine the Classification**:
   - A regular hexagon (where all sides and angles are equal) has each angle measuring \(120^\circ\). In this case, it is an equiangular shape.
   - An irregular hexagon may have angles that vary in size, making it non-equiangular.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since you have counted 6 angles in the hexagon, you can then determine its classification based on whether the angles are equal or not.

In summary, a hexagon has 6 angles. If all angles are equal, it is equiangular; if they vary, it is non-equiangular. To classify a specific hexagon, you need to assess the measurements of its angles."

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangular garden.

The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

\[
\text{Area of Rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]

In this case, the length is 8 meters and the width is 5 meters:

\[
\text{Area of Rectangle} = 8 \, \text{meters} \times 5 \, \text{meters} = 40 \, \text{square meters}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the triangular flower bed.

The formula for the area of a triangle is:

\[
\text{Area of Triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

In this case, the base is 4 meters and the height is 3 meters:

\[
\text{Area of Triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \, \text{meters} \times 3 \, \text{meters} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \, \text{square meters} = 6 \, \text{square meters}
\]

### Step 3: Add the areas together.

Now, add the area of the rectangular garden to the area of the triangular flower bed:

\[
\text{Total Area} = \text{Area of Rectangle} + \text{Area of Triangle}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Area} = 40 \, \text{square meters} + 6 \, \text{square meters} = 46 \, \text{square meters}

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the square section.

The formula for the area \( A \) of a square is:

\[
A = \text{side} \times \text{side}
\]

In your case, the side of the square is 6 feet:

\[
A_{\text{square}} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 6 \, \text{feet} = 36 \, \text{square feet}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the rectangular section.

The formula for the area \( A \) of a rectangle is:

\[
A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]

For the rectangular section, the length is 4 feet and the width is 3 feet:

\[
A_{\text{rectangle}} = 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 12 \, \text{square feet}
\]

### Step 3: Add the areas together.

Now, combine the areas of both sections:

\[

1. **Calculate the Area of the Rectangular Part**:
   - The area \( A_{rectangle} \) of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     A_{rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - In this case, the length is 10 meters and the width is 5 meters.
     \[
     A_{rectangle} = 10 \, \text{m} \times 5 \, \text{m} = 50 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

2. **Calculate the Area of the Semicircular Slide**:
   - The area \( A_{circle} \) of a full circle is given by:
     \[
     A_{circle} = \pi r^2
     \]
   - The diameter of the semicircular slide is given as 4 meters, so the radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:
     \[
     r = \frac{4 \, \text{m}}{2} = 2 \, \text{m}
     \]
   - Now, calculate the area of the full circle using the radius:
     \[
     A_{circle} = \pi (2 \, \text{m})^2 = \pi \times 4 \, \text{m}^2 = 4\pi \, \text{m}^2
     \]
   - However, since the slide is a semicircle, we need to take half of this area:
     \[
     A_{semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} A_{circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\pi \, \text{m}^2 = 2\pi \, \text{m}^2
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Area of the Playground**:
   - To find the total area \( A_{total} \) of the playground, you simply add the area of the rectangle and the area of the semicircle:
     \[
     A_{total} = A_{rectangle} + A_{semicircle}
     \]
     \[
     A_{total} = 50 \, \text{m}^2 + 2\pi \, \text{m}^2
     \]
   - You can leave it in this form. If you want to calculate a numerical approximation, you can use \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
     \[
     2\pi \approx 2 \times 3.14 = 6.28 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
     \[
     A_{total} \approx 50 \, \text{m}^2 + 6.28 \, \text{m}^2 \approx 56.28 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

Thus, the total area of the playground is:
\[
A_{total} = 50 \, \text{m}^2 + 2\pi \, \text{m}^2 \quad \text{or approximately} \quad 56.28 \, \text{m}^2

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the task:

1. **Understanding the Angle Measurements**: You have a quadrilateral with angles measuring 70°, 110°, 70°, and 110°.

2. **Sum of Angles in a Quadrilateral**: The first thing to check is whether the sum of the angles in your quadrilateral is equal to 360° (which is a property of all quadrilaterals).
   - Calculate: 
     \[
     70° + 110° + 70° + 110° = 360°
     \]

3. **Checking for Parallel Sides**: In a trapezoid, at least one pair of sides must be parallel. One way to determine if there is a pair of parallel sides is to analyze the angles. 

   - In the angles given, notice that the angles are in two pairs: two angles are 70° and two angles are 110°. In geometry, when you have two angles that are equal (in this case, 70° on one side and 110° on the other side), the sides opposite these angles can be parallel, especially if they are consecutive angles.

4. **Analyzing the Consecutive Angles**: In the case of trapezoids, if one pair of opposite angles are equal (like 70° and 110°), it reinforces the possibility of having parallel sides.

Given that:
- You have two angles of 70° and two angles of 110°, the arrangement suggests that these angles can form a situation where one pair of sides is parallel.

5. **Concluding**: Since there is one pair of equal angles opposite each other and because the sum of angles is valid, you can conclude that the given quadrilateral is indeed a trapezoid.

### Summary
Yes, the quadrilateral formed by the angles 70°, 110°, 70°, and 110° is a trapezoid because:
- The sum of the angles is 360°.
- There is one pair of equal angles which implies that there can be at least one pair of parallel sides in accordance with the definition of a trapezoid."

Here is how you can solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the angles**: You have angle A = 40 degrees and angle B = 70 degrees.

2. **Set up the equation**: According to the triangle angle sum property, the sum of angles A, B, and C should equal 180 degrees:

   \]

4. **Combine the known angles**: Add the measures of angles A and B together:
   \[
   110^\circ + C = 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for angle C**: To find angle C, subtract the sum of angles A and B from 180 degrees:
   \[
   C = 180^\circ - 110^\circ

   \[
   C = 70^\circ

   - \( C(x_1, 0) \) and \( D(12 - 8, 0) = D(4, 0) \). Then \( x_1 = 4 \) gives \( C(4, 0) \).

4. **Identify the length of the diagonal**: You can now calculate the length of diagonal \( AC \) using the distance formula:
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_A)^2 + (0 - y_A)^2}
   \]
   where \( A(0, 5) \) and \( C(4, 0) \). Therefore:
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (0 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{16 + 25} = \sqrt{41}
   \]

5. **Lastly, calculate the diagonal length**: Using the diagonal found:
   - The length of diagonal \( AC \) is \( \sqrt{41} \) cm.

If you want to calculate \( BD \) similarly, you would use the distance formula for points \( B(12, 5) \) and \( D(4, 0) \) and find it to be the same, confirming diagonal lengths in the trapezoid are equivalent.

In conclusion, the length of the diagonal of the trapezoid is \( \sqrt{41} \) cm."

This means that for triangle \(ABC\), the following equation holds true:

\[
\text{Angle A} + \text{Angle B} + \text{Angle C} = 180^\circ
\]

Given in the problem:
- Angle A = \(35^\circ\)
- Angle B = \(75^\circ\)

You need to find the measure of Angle C. Let's denote Angle C as \(C\).

Now, plug the known values into the equation:

\[
35^\circ + 75^\circ + C = 180^\circ
\]

First, add the measures of angles A and B:

\[
35^\circ + 75^\circ = 110^\circ
\]

Now, substitute this back into the equation:

\[
110^\circ + C = 180^\circ
\]

To isolate \(C\), subtract \(110^\circ\) from both sides:

\[
C = 180^\circ - 110^\circ
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
C = 70^\circ
\]

Therefore, the measure of angle C is \(70^\circ\)."
"Space and form","Properties and relationships of figures and solids","F","A triangle has an exterior angle that measures 120 degrees; if one of the opposite interior angles measures 45 degrees what is the measure of the other interior angle?","To solve this task, you can use the properties of angles in a triangle and the relationship between exterior and interior angles.

### Steps to Solve

1. **Understand the relationship between exterior and interior angles**: The exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. In this case:
   \[
   \text{Exterior angle} = \text{Interior angle 1} + \text{Interior angle 2}
   \]

2. **Identify what you're given**: 
   - The exterior angle is 120 degrees.
   - One of the opposite interior angles (let's call it \(A\)) is 45 degrees.

3. **Set up the equation based on the relationship**:
   Let \(B\) be the measure of the other interior angle. According to the angle relationship:
   \[
   120^\circ = 45^\circ + B
   \]

4. **Solve for the unknown angle \(B\)**:
   Rearranging the equation gives:
   \[
   B = 120^\circ - 45^\circ
   \]

5. **Calculate \(B\)**:
   \[
   B = 75^\circ
   \]

### Conclusion

So, the measure of the other interior angle is \(75\) degrees. Thus, the answer to your task is:

**The measure of the other interior angle is 75 degrees.**"
"Space and form","Properties and relationships of figures and solids","F","In a polygon with five sides if three of the interior angles are 90 degrees each find the measure of the remaining two interior angles.","To solve the problem of finding the remaining interior angles of a polygon (specifically a pentagon) where three of the angles are 90 degrees, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon**:
   The sum of the interior angles \( S \) of an n-sided polygon can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = (n - 2) \times 180
   \]
   For a pentagon (which has 5 sides), we have \( n = 5 \):
   \[
   S = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 3 \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
   \]

2. **Add up the known angles**:
   You know that three of the interior angles are 90 degrees each. So, you can calculate their total:
   \[
   \text{Total of known angles} = 90 + 90 + 90 = 270 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Find the measure of the remaining angles**:
   Let the remaining two angles be \( x \) and \( y \). The total of all five angles must equal the sum found in step 1:
   \[
   270 + x + y = 540
   \]
   To find \( x + y \), rearrange the equation:
   \[
   x + y = 540 - 270 = 270 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Determine possible values for the remaining angles**:
   Since you know that \( x + y = 270 \), there are many combinations for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this equation. However, you should also remember that both \( x \) and \( y \) need to be less than 180 degrees for them to be valid interior angles of a polygon.

   For example, if you decide that \( x = 135 \), then:
   \[
   y = 270 - 135 = 135 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Or you could take a different approach, such as:
   \[
   x = 150 \text{ degrees and } y = 120 \text{ degrees} 
   \]
   as another valid pair.

Therefore, the measures of the remaining two interior angles can vary as long as they add up to 270 degrees and are each less than 180 degrees. You have flexibility in choosing \( x \) and \( y \) within these constraints."
"Space and form","Properties and relationships of figures and solids","G","Calculate the surface area of a rectangular prism with dimensions 4 cm (length) 3 cm (width) and 5 cm (height).","To calculate the surface area of a rectangular prism, you need to consider all six faces of the prism. A rectangular prism has three pairs of opposite faces, and the formula for the surface area (SA) is given by:

\[
\text{SA} = 2(lw + lh + wh)
\]

where:
- \(l\) is the length,
- \(w\) is the width,
- \(h\) is the height.

Given the dimensions of your prism:
- Length (l) = 4 cm
- Width (w) = 3 cm
- Height (h) = 5 cm

Now, let's substitute these values into the formula step-by-step.

1. Calculate each of the products:
   - \(lw = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 3 \, \text{cm} = 12 \, \text{cm}^2\)
   - \(lh = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm} = 20 \, \text{cm}^2\)
   - \(wh = 3 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm} = 15 \, \text{cm}^2\)

2. Add the areas of these three products together:
   \[
   lw + lh + wh = 12 \, \text{cm}^2 + 20 \, \text{cm}^2 + 15 \, \text{cm}^2 = 47 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

3. Now multiply this sum by 2 to account for both pairs of opposite faces:
   \[
   \text{SA} = 2 \times 47 \, \text{cm}^2 = 94 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

So, the surface area of the rectangular prism is **94 cm²**."

\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]

where:
- \( V \) is the volume,
- \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder,
- \( \pi \) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

In your case:
- The radius \( r \) is 2 meters,
- The height \( h \) is 3 meters.

Now, you can substitute the values into the formula:

1. First, calculate the area of the base (which is a circle) using \( r^2 \):
   \[
   r^2 = 2^2 = 4 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

2. Next, multiply this by \( \pi \) and the height \( h \):
   \[
   V = \pi \cdot 4 \cdot 3
   \]

3. Now calculate the volume:
   \[
   V = 12\pi \, \text{cubic meters}

So, the volume of the cylindrical water tank is \( 12\pi \) cubic meters, or approximately \( 37.68 \) cubic meters if you use the approximation for \( \pi \)."
"Space and form","Properties and relationships of figures and solids","G","Determine the total surface area of a cylinder that has a radius of 6 inches and a height of 10 inches including the areas of both circular bases.","To determine the total surface area of a cylinder, you need to consider the surface area of both the curved side (lateral area) and the two circular bases. The formula for the total surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[
A = 2\pi rh + 2\pi r^2
\]

Where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder.
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.
- \( \pi \) (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how to calculate it:

1. **Identify the values for radius and height**:
   - Radius \( r = 6 \) inches
   - Height \( h = 10 \) inches

2. **Calculate the lateral surface area**:
   The lateral surface area (the area of the side) can be calculated using the formula \( 2\pi rh \):
   \[
   \text{Lateral Area} = 2\pi(6)(10) = 120\pi
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the two circular bases**:
   Each base has an area given by \( \pi r^2 \):
   \[
   \text{Area of one base} = \pi(6)^2 = 36\pi
   \]
   Since there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:
   \[
   \text{Total Area of Bases} = 2(36\pi) = 72\pi
   \]

4. **Add both areas together**:
   Now, add the lateral area and the area of the bases together to find the total surface area:
   \[
   A = \text{Lateral Area} + \text{Total Area of Bases} = 120\pi + 72\pi = 192\pi
   \]

5. **Calculate a numerical approximation** (if necessary):
   If you want a numerical approximation for the total surface area, you can use \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
   \[
   A \approx 192 \times 3.14 \approx 602.88 \text{ square inches}
   \]

In conclusion, the total surface area of the cylinder is \( 192\pi \) square inches, or approximately \( 602.88 \) square inches when calculated numerically."
"Space and form","Properties and relationships of figures and solids","H","In triangle ABC if angle A = angle D and the lengths of side AB = 6 cm and side DE = 9 cm determine the length of side AC if triangle ABC is similar to triangle ADE.","To solve the problem, we need to make use of the fact that triangles ABC and ADE are similar. This means that their corresponding sides are in proportion.

Similar triangles have the property that the ratios of the lengths of corresponding sides are equal. Given that:

- \( \angle A = \angle D \) (corresponding angles are equal),
- \( AB = 6 \, \text{cm} \),
- \( DE = 9 \, \text{cm} \),

we can set up the proportion based on the corresponding sides of the triangles. 

In the similar triangles ABC and ADE:
- Side AB corresponds to side DE.
- Side AC corresponds to side AE (we need to find the length of AC).

We can write the ratio of the sides as follows:

\[
\frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{AC}{AE}
\]

Substituting the known values into the proportion, we have:

\[
\frac{6}{9} = \frac{AC}{AE}
\]

Now, simplify the left side:

\[
\frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

So, we can rewrite the proportion as:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{AC}{AE}
\]

Now, let's denote the length of side AC as \( x \). The proportion can now be expressed as:

\[
\frac{x}{AE} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Next, to find the length of AC, we'll express AE in terms of the other side of triangle ADE if we had that. However, in this problem, we don't have the length of AE, making it unclear how exactly to resolve without additional information. 

If we instead assume that we know side AE, we could plug that value in and solve for \( x \):

1. Rearranging gives:
   \[
   x = \frac{2}{3} \cdot AE
   \]

2. You would substitute the known value of AE into this equation to find the length of AC.

If AE is not given in the problem, we cannot determine AC directly without more information about triangle ADE. If other sides or angles in triangle ADE are given, you could use those to find AE and then find AC through the proportion established. 

In conclusion, the steps to take are:
1. Set up the ratio from the fact that the triangles are similar.
2. Simplify the ratio.
3. Solve for the desired length based on known values.

However, if there are no more dimensions given for triangle ADE (like AE or another corresponding angle), further information would be required to calculate the specific length of AC."

Since \( PQR \) and \( STU \) are similar triangles, their corresponding sides have the same ratio. 

Given the information:
- \( PR \) (corresponding to side \( TU \)) is \( 10 \, cm \).
- \( TU \) is \( 15 \, cm \).
- \( ST \) is \( 12 \, cm \), and we're looking for \( PQ \) (corresponding to \( ST \)).

### Step 1: Set up the ratio of corresponding sides.

The ratio of the sides of the triangles can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{PR}{TU} = \frac{PQ}{ST}
\]

### Step 2: Substitute the known values into the ratio.

Substituting the known values:
\[
\frac{10}{15} = \frac{PQ}{12}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the ratio \( \frac{10}{15} \).

Simplifying this ratio gives:
\[
\frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
\]
So now we have:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{PQ}{12}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( PQ \).

To find \( PQ \), cross-multiply:
\[
2 \cdot 12 = 3 \cdot PQ
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
24 = 3 \cdot PQ

Now, divide both sides by 3:
\[
PQ = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \, cm

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand Similarity**: Since triangle XYZ is similar to triangle ABC, the corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional. This means that the ratios of the lengths of corresponding sides are equal.

2. **Identify Corresponding Sides**: From the problem, we have:
   - Side XY corresponds to side BC
   - Side XZ corresponds to side AC (though the length of AC isn't provided, the similarity conditions may still lead us to our goal)
   
   We know:
   - XY = 5 m
   - BC = 15 m

3. **Set Up the Proportion**:
   The ratio of XY to BC can be set up as follows:

   \[
   \frac{XY}{BC} = \frac{XZ}{AC}
   \]

   Here, we want to find XZ, but we do not know AC, so let's first focus on establishing the ratio between XY and BC.

4. **Calculate the Ratio**:
   Calculate the ratio based on the lengths you have:

   \[
   \frac{XY}{BC} = \frac{5 \text{ m}}{15 \text{ m}} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

5. **Set up the new equation for XZ**:
   If AC is represented in terms of XZ, and as we know the proportion is the same:

   \[
   \frac{XZ}{AC} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

6. **Find the Missing Length (XZ)**:
   Unfortunately, without the length of side AC, we cannot solve for the specific length of side XZ directly. If you would provide the length of AC, you can then multiply it by \( \frac{1}{3} \) to find the value of XZ.

However, if the problem gives you further information regarding side AC, substitute that value into the equation:

\[
XZ = \frac{1}{3} \times AC
\]

### Conclusion:
To successfully calculate the missing length of XZ, ensure you have the value of AC or any additional information about the triangles. Then apply the ratio accordingly to find the solution."

1. **Identify the Center Line**: First, determine where the center line of the butterfly is. This could be a vertical line that runs down the middle of the drawing, dividing the butterfly into left and right halves.

2. **Analyze the Left Wing**: Look closely at the left wing of the butterfly. Take note of its shape, patterns, and any details it contains, such as colors, markings, or textures.

3. **Reflect the Wing**: To reflect the left wing, you need to create a mirror image of it on the right side of the center line. Imagine flipping the left wing over the center line, so every point on the left wing has a corresponding point on the right wing.

    - **Point-by-Point Reflection**: For accuracy, you can trace points from the left wing. For each point on the left, measure the distance from the center line and mark a corresponding point on the right side, at the same distance from the center line.

4. **Draw the Right Wing**: Using the points you’ve plotted, sketch the outline of the right wing by connecting these points. Make sure the shape and proportion of the wing closely match that of the left wing.

5. **Add Patterns and Details**: If the left wing has specific patterns or details (like spots or stripes), replicate these exactly on the right wing, mirroring their placement in relation to the center line.

6. **Final Touches**: Once the outline and patterns are done, you can add color, shading, or any additional details to the right wing to complete the butterfly, ensuring that both wings look symmetrical and cohesive.

1. **Identify the Line of Symmetry**: First, determine where the vertical line of symmetry is. This line runs down the center of your heart shape, dividing it into two equal halves.

2. **Draw the Existing Half**: If you already have one half of the heart drawn (let’s say the left side), ensure it is clear and defined. 

3. **Locate Corresponding Points**: For each point on the existing half of the heart, find the corresponding point on the opposite side of the vertical line of symmetry. This means for every point on the left side, there will be a mirror point on the right side.

4. **Plot the Mirror Points**: For example, if a point on the left side is at (x1, y1), then the point on the right side, which is symmetrical, would be at (-x1, y1). You need to do this for multiple key points along the curve of the heart.

1. **Identify the Center**: First, locate the center point of the existing star design. This will typically involve finding the midpoint of the bounding shape or using a grid overlay if you have one.

2. **Analyze Existing Points**: Look at the points that are already present in the star design. Note their positions relative to the center. Identify the angles at which the points are placed around the center.

3. **Determine the Number of Points Needed**: Count how many points your star currently has and identify how many additional points are required to balance it out. A star usually has an even or an odd number of points, and they must be placed evenly around the center.

4. **Use Symmetry**: For every point that exists, determine its symmetrical counterpart across the center. For example, if there is a point at (x, y) on one side of the center, you will want to place a corresponding point at (-x, -y). If the points are arranged in a circular pattern, you can use angles to find the necessary missing points by dividing the circle into equal segments.

5. **Calculate Angles**: If your star design is based on angles, calculate the angle between each point. For a symmetrical star, you can use the total angle of a circle (360 degrees) divided by the number of points to find how far apart they need to be placed. 

6. **Place the Missing Points**: Once you have the necessary calculations and placements, plot or draw the missing points according to your determined angular or coordinate points.

7. **Connect the Points**: Finally, once all the points are placed, connect them in order to form the complete and symmetrical star shape. Make sure to check that all lines create the intended star design.

8. **Review for Symmetry**: After completing the design, review it to ensure all parts mirror each other properly and adjust as necessary.

"Space and form","Symmetries and illustrations","D","Create a tessellation using at least three different congruent shapes and color each shape differently to enhance your design.","Creating a tessellation with at least three different congruent shapes can be a fun and creative task! Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you with this project:

### Step 1: Understand Tessellation

A tessellation is a pattern made of one or more shapes that fit together perfectly without any gaps or overlaps. The shapes used in the tessellation can be regular (like squares or equilateral triangles) or irregular, but key to your task is that these shapes must be congruent, meaning each shape is identical in size and shape.

### Step 2: Choose Your Shapes

1. **Select Three Shapes**: Decide on three different shapes that will tessellate. Common choices include:
   - Equilateral triangles
   - Squares
   - Hexagons
   - Rhombuses
   - L-shapes
   You can also modify existing shapes, like rotating or flipping them, to create variation while maintaining congruency.

### Step 3: Create a Template

1. **Draw the Basic Shape**: On a piece of paper or using a digital tool, start by drawing one of your chosen shapes. Ensure it is proportionate.
2. **Copy the Shape**: Make multiple duplicates of your chosen shapes, ensuring they maintain congruency.
3. **Arrange the Shapes**: Begin arranging the shapes in a way that they fit together without gaps or overlaps. You might need to rotate or flip some shapes to achieve a complete filling of the space. Experiment with different arrangements until you find a layout that works.

### Step 4: Define the Tessellation Pattern

1. **Create a Grid**: Draw a grid or an outline where your tessellation will go. This will serve as a guide for maintaining the overall layout.
2. **Fill the Space**: Continue adding your chosen shapes into the grid. Make sure to alternate the shapes in a systematic way to keep the pattern consistent throughout.

### Step 5: Color the Shapes

1. **Select Your Colors**: Choose a color palette that appeals to you. You can select colors that complement each other or use contrasting colors for a vibrant effect.
2. **Color Each Shape Differently**: Go through the shapes in your tessellation and color each one differently while keeping the overall design in mind. You could use solid colors, gradients, or even patterns within each shape.

### Step 6: Finalize Your Design

1. **Review and Adjust**: Look over your tessellation and make any adjustments you feel necessary. Ensure that all shapes are consistently colored and there are no gaps.
2. **Outline**: Consider outlining the shapes with a pen or marker to make your tessellation pop.
3. **Presentation**: If you are displaying your work, consider mounting it on a larger piece of paper or in a frame.

### Optional: Digital Tessellation

If you prefer a digital approach, you can use graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator or free tools like Inkscape:

1. **Create Shape Vectors**: Use the shape tool to create congruent shapes.
2. **Duplicate and Arrange**: Use the arrange tools to duplicate and fit your shapes together.
3. **Color and Finish**: Use the fill tool to add color to your shapes.

### Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to successfully create a tessellation using at least three different congruent shapes, each colored differently. Remember, the key to a great tessellation is making sure that the shapes fit together smoothly, so take your time to experiment and find the best arrangement!

"Space and form","Symmetries and illustrations","D","Design a floor plan for a room using congruent hexagonal tiles ensuring that the entire floor is covered without any gaps or overlaps.","Designing a floor plan using congruent hexagonal tiles requires a few steps to ensure that the entire area is covered without gaps or overlaps. Here’s how you can approach the task:

### Step 1: Understand the Tile Shape

Hexagonal tiles are shaped as regular hexagons, meaning all sides are equal and all angles are 120 degrees. Each tile can fit together with its neighbors, creating a tessellating pattern.

### Step 2: Decide on the Room Dimensions

- **Determine the size** of your room. For example, specify a rectangular or irregularly-shaped area.
- **Calculate the area** of the room to help determine how many hexagonal tiles will be needed.

### Step 3: Calculate the Tile Dimensions

- **Determine the size of each hexagonal tile**. The distance from one flat side to the opposite flat side is known as the ""height,"" while the distance across opposite vertices is called the ""diameter.""
- If you know the dimensions you want for your room, calculate how many tiles will fit based on their size.

### Step 4: Plan the Layout

- **Create a grid on paper or digitally** to visualize how the hexagonal tiles will fit in the room.
- Start from a corner and work your way across the floor plan, placing tiles side by side. Remember each hexagon will overlap slightly with the adjacent ones.

### Step 5: Ensure Coverage Without Gaps

- **Row arrangement:** Place the first row of hexagons horizontally (or vertically), leaving no gaps.
- For the next row, offset the hexagons so they fit into the spaces of the previous row. This is essential for hexagons as they fit together in a staggered pattern.
- Continue this until the entire area is covered. Make sure the edges of the tiles touch without any spaces.

### Step 6: Adjust for Irregular Shapes

If your room is not a perfect rectangle:

- You may need to **cut tiles** to fit into corners or along edges. You can accomplish this by measuring the remaining space and cutting the hexagon to fit.
- Use tracing paper or a template for the hexagons to visualize how they will fit in irregular sections.

### Step 7: Finalize the Plan

- Review your layout to ensure it is aesthetically pleasing and functional.
- Ensure that you have accounted for any fittings like walls, doors, or furniture which may affect how the tiles are laid out.
- If possible, create a digital model using design software that allows for precise placement of the tiles.

### Step 8: Installation

Once your design is finalized:

- Gather the materials, ensuring you have enough tiles and any necessary adhesive.

- A large piece of paper (or several sheets taped together)
- A ruler
- A pencil
- Colored markers, paints, or other art supplies (optional)

### Steps to Create Your Tessellated Mural

1. **Understand Tessellation**: Tessellation is a pattern made of one or more shapes that fit together without any gaps or overlaps. In this case, you will be using squares and triangles.

2. **Start with a Grid**:
   - Use a ruler to draw a grid on your paper. This will help you maintain equal size for your shapes.
   - For simplicity, consider making the squares 2 inches on each side.

3. **Choose Your Shapes**:
   - You will use squares and triangles. You can use right triangles (with a 90-degree angle) as they fit easily with squares.
   - Consider the orientation: you can have triangles pointing up and down or to the sides.

4. **Plan Your Layout**:
   - Decide how you want to arrange the squares and triangles. A common design is to alternate squares and triangles.
   - For example, place a square, then two triangles on one side (forming a triangular shape), then a square again.

5. **Draw the Shapes**:
   - Start filling your grid with squares and triangles. 
   - To ensure no gaps, try placing triangles in such a way that their bases align with the sides of squares.

6. **Check for Gaps**:
   - As you draw, periodically check for any gaps between the shapes. Adjust the placement of your triangles and squares as needed.

7. **Add Details**:
   - Once you have an arrangement that covers your paper without gaps, you can add colors or patterns to your shapes.
   - For example, you might color all the squares blue and all the triangles red or create a pattern.

8. **Review Your Tessellation**:
   - Make sure each shape connects correctly and that the pattern is consistent across your mural.
   - Experience with geometric shapes might inspire you to create more complex patterns or shapes.

9. **Finalize**:

"Space and form","Symmetries and illustrations","E","Draw all the lines of symmetry for a regular hexagon and explain how you determined their positions.","To find the lines of symmetry for a regular hexagon, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understanding the Shape
A regular hexagon has six equal-length sides and six equal angles (each measuring 120 degrees). It is a polygon with a center point, and this symmetry allows it to be divided evenly.

### Step 2: Identify the Types of Symmetry
1. **Rotational Symmetry**: A regular hexagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated around its center and still look the same at certain angles. Specifically, it can be rotated by 60 degrees, 120 degrees, 180 degrees, 240 degrees, and 300 degrees without changing its appearance.

2. **Reflectional Symmetry**: A regular hexagon has multiple lines of symmetry that can be drawn through it.

### Step 3: Drawing the Lines of Symmetry
**There are 6 lines of symmetry in a regular hexagon**, which can be determined as follows:

1. **Through Opposite Vertices**: You can draw three lines of symmetry by connecting opposite pairs of vertices. For example, if you have vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F, the lines would connect:
   - A to D
   - B to E
   - C to F

2. **Through Midpoints of Opposite Sides**: You can also draw three lines of symmetry through the midpoints of opposite sides. These lines will go from the midpoint of one side directly to the midpoint of the side opposite it. For example:
   - The midpoint of side AB to the midpoint of side DE
   - The midpoint of side BC to the midpoint of side EF
   - The midpoint of side CD to the midpoint of side AF

### Step 4: Visual Representation
When you draw the regular hexagon and its lines of symmetry, you will see that:
- Each line of symmetry divides the hexagon into two mirror-image halves.
- The lines intersect at the same center point of the hexagon.

### Conclusion
In summary:
- A regular hexagon has **6 lines of symmetry**.
- **3 lines pass through opposite vertices** and **3 lines pass through midpoints of opposite sides**.
- You can verify the symmetry by folding the hexagon along any of these lines; the corresponding halves will perfectly coincide.

By carefully drawing and analyzing the hexagon and these lines, you can understand its symmetrical properties clearly!"
"Space and form","Symmetries and illustrations","E","Identify whether a regular pentagon has any lines of symmetry and if so illustrate them on a diagram.","To determine whether a regular pentagon has lines of symmetry, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Definition**: A line of symmetry is a line that divides a shape into two identical halves that are mirror images of each other.

2. **Analyze the Regular Pentagon**:
   - A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles.
   - The key characteristic of regular shapes is their uniformity and balance, leading to potential symmetrical lines.

3. **Finding the Lines of Symmetry**:
   - For a regular pentagon, you can find symmetry by testing lines that go through the vertices (corners) and the center of the pentagon.
   - Since a regular pentagon has five vertices, you can draw a line from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

4. **Number of Symmetric Lines**: 
   - Each vertex can create a line of symmetry. Therefore, there are five lines of symmetry in total.
   - These lines will start at a vertex and bisect the angle formed at that vertex leading to the opposite side. 

5. **Illustrate the Diagram**:
   - Draw a regular pentagon.
   - Identify and label the vertices (e.g., A, B, C, D, E).
   - Draw a line from point A to the midpoint of side BC, repeat this for each vertex (B to CD, C to DE, D to EA, and E to AB).
   - The diagram should now show the pentagon with these five lines, which should all intersect at the center of the pentagon.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - State that a regular pentagon has five lines of symmetry, each corresponding to a vertex.
   - Conclusively, these lines confirm the nature of the regular pentagon, exhibiting that it can indeed be reflected across these lines.

By conducting this analysis and creating the diagram, you will effectively illustrate the lines of symmetry of a regular pentagon."

2. Multiply \( r^2 \) by the height \( h \):
   \[
   r^2 \cdot h = 9 \cdot 10 = 90
   \]

3. Finally, multiply that result by \( \pi \):
   \[
   V = \pi \cdot 90
   \]
   If you want a numerical approximation of the volume, you can use \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
   \[
   V \approx 3.14 \cdot 90 \approx 282.6 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

So the volume of the cylindrical water tank is approximately \( 282.6 \) cubic feet. If you prefer a more precise answer, you can simply leave it in terms of \( \pi \):

\[
V = 90\pi \text{ cubic feet} \quad (\text{which is approximately } 282.6 \text{ cubic feet})

The goal is to determine which brand provides the least excess flour and which brand provides the most excess flour when measuring out the required amount. Here’s how you can do this step-by-step:

1. **List the weights of the brands**:
   - Brand A: 240 grams
   - Brand B: 260 grams
   - Brand C: 270 grams

2. **Calculate the excess flour for each brand**:
   - Excess flour is calculated as the weight of the brand minus 250 grams.
   - If the result is negative, it means you won't have enough flour, and thus, we’ll treat it as zero excess.

   - **Brand A** (240 grams):
     - Excess = 240 - 250 = -10 grams (not enough, so we treat this as 0 grams excess)

   - **Brand B** (260 grams):
     - Excess = 260 - 250 = 10 grams

   - **Brand C** (270 grams):
     - Excess = 270 - 250 = 20 grams

3. **Summarize the results**:
   - Brand A: 0 grams excess (not enough flour)
   - Brand B: 10 grams excess
   - Brand C: 20 grams excess

4. **Identify the brands with least and most excess**:
   - The brand that allows for the **least excess flour** (which is effectively zero since it doesn't meet the requirement) is **Brand A**.
   - The brand that allows for the **most excess flour** is **Brand C**, with 20 grams excess.

This way, you can clearly determine which brand's weight accommodates the recipe's requirement most effectively in terms of excess flour."
"Sizes and measurement","Recording and comparing quantities","H","A survey of monthly water usage in three households shows usage of 150 180 and 210 liters; analyze the data to find the median and discuss what this reveals about the typical water consumption in these households.","To solve the task of finding the median water usage from the data provided (150 liters, 180 liters, and 210 liters) and to discuss what this reveals about typical water consumption, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Organize the Data
First, list the monthly water usage in ascending order:
- 150 liters
- 180 liters
- 210 liters

### Step 2: Calculate the Median
The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. Since you have an odd number of data points (three), the median is simply the value that falls in the middle.

1. **Identify the Values**:
   - First value: 150 liters
   - Second value (middle value): 180 liters
   - Third value: 210 liters

2. **Find the Median**:
   - In this case, the median is the second value: **180 liters**.

### Step 3: Interpret the Median
Now that you have calculated the median, interpret what this tells you about the typical water consumption in these households.

1. **Typical Water Consumption**: 
   - The median of 180 liters indicates that half of the households surveyed use less than 180 liters of water per month, and half use more. This value represents a middle point, which is less affected by extreme values (like the highest consumption of 210 liters in this case).

2. **Comparison with Usage Data**:
   - The usage varies from 150 liters to 210 liters. Since the median (180 liters) is closer to the lower end of the range, it demonstrates that a significant portion of households may be using moderate amounts of water rather than very high amounts.

3. **Conclusions**:
   - Given that the median is not skewed too high, it suggests that typical water consumption in these households is relatively moderate, and at least half of the surveyed households are within the lower range of consumption. It may also imply that conserving water could be a viable option for these households.

### Final Thoughts:
This analysis not only provides the median, which is a statistical measure, but also offers insights into water usage patterns among the households. The findings can be valuable for discussions around water conservation, resource management, and understanding household behavior regarding water usage."

Here's how to do it step by step:

1. **Understand the formulas:**
   - The lateral surface area (A_lateral) of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     A_{\text{lateral}} = 2 \pi r h
     \]
     where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.
   
   - The area of the top and bottom bases (A_bases) can be calculated with the formula:
     \[
     A_{\text{bases}} = 2 \pi r^2
     \]
     since there are two circular bases (top and bottom).

2. **Identify the given values:**
   - Radius \( r = 3 \) cm
   - Height \( h = 10 \) cm

3. **Calculate the lateral surface area:**
   \[
   A_{\text{lateral}} = 2 \pi (3 \text{ cm}) (10 \text{ cm}) = 60 \pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

4. **Calculate the area of the bases:**
   \[
   A_{\text{bases}} = 2 \pi (3 \text{ cm})^2 = 2 \pi (9 \text{ cm}^2) = 18 \pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

5. **Find the total surface area:**
   The total surface area (A_total) is the sum of the lateral surface area and the area of the bases:
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{lateral}} + A_{\text{bases}} = 60 \pi \text{ cm}^2 + 18 \pi \text{ cm}^2 = 78 \pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   To get a numerical value, you can approximate \(\pi \) as 3.14 (or use a more precise value if needed):
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} \approx 78 \times 3.14 \text{ cm}^2 \approx 244.92 \text{ cm}^2
   \]

So, the total surface area of the cylindrical container is approximately \( 244.92 \text{ cm}^2 \).

"Sizes and measurement","Calculating quantities","F","Determine the surface area of a composite shape made up of a cube with side length 6 cm and a hemisphere with a radius of 3 cm attached to the top.","To determine the surface area of the composite shape made up of a cube and a hemisphere, you need to follow several steps. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Step 1: Calculate the Surface Area of the Cube

The formula for the surface area (SA) of a cube is:
\[
SA_{\text{cube}} = 6s^2
\]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube.

For a cube with side length \( s = 6 \) cm:
\[
SA_{\text{cube}} = 6 \times (6 \text{ cm})^2 = 6 \times 36 \text{ cm}^2 = 216 \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Surface Area of the Hemisphere

The formula for the surface area of a hemisphere (including the flat base) is:
\[
SA_{\text{hemisphere}} = 2\pi r^2 + \pi r^2
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the hemisphere. 

However, since the hemisphere is attached to the cube, we only need to calculate the curved surface area of the hemisphere:
\[
SA_{\text{curved hemisphere}} = 2\pi r^2
\]

For a hemisphere with radius \( r = 3 \) cm:
\[
SA_{\text{curved hemisphere}} = 2\pi (3 \text{ cm})^2 = 2\pi \cdot 9 \text{ cm}^2 = 18\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Combine the Surface Areas

When combining the surface areas, note that the flat circular base of the hemisphere will not contribute to the total surface area since it is in contact with the cube. Therefore, we will only add the surface area of the cube and the curved surface area of the hemisphere:
\[
SA_{\text{total}} = SA_{\text{cube}} + SA_{\text{curved hemisphere}}
\]
\[
SA_{\text{total}} = 216 \text{ cm}^2 + 18\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Step 4: Final Calculation

If you need a numerical value, you can approximate \( \pi \) (use \( \pi \approx 3.14 \)):
\[
SA_{\text{total}} \approx 216 \text{ cm}^2 + 18 \times 3.14 \text{ cm}^2 \approx 216 \text{ cm}^2 + 56.52 \text{ cm}^2 \approx 272.52 \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Conclusion

The total surface area of the composite shape is:
\[
SA_{\text{total}} = 216 \text{ cm}^2 + 18\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]
If you want to express it in decimal form (if needed), it will be approximately \( 272.52 \text{ cm}^2 \)."
"Sizes and measurement","Quantities in factual contexts","G","A ladder leans against a wall forming a right triangle with the ground; if the ladder is 15 feet long and the base is 9 feet away from the wall how tall is the wall?","To solve this problem, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which is used for right triangles. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In this scenario:
- The ladder represents the hypotenuse (c) and is 15 feet long.
- The distance from the base of the ladder to the wall represents one leg of the triangle (a), which is 9 feet.
- The height of the wall represents the other leg of the triangle (b), which we need to find.

According to the Pythagorean theorem, the relationship can be summarized as follows:

\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \]

Substituting the known values into the equation:
- \( c = 15 \) feet (the length of the ladder)
- \( a = 9 \) feet (the distance from the wall)

Now, plug the values into the equation:

\[ 15^2 = 9^2 + b^2 \]

Calculating the squares:

\[ 225 = 81 + b^2 \]

Now, isolate \( b^2 \) by subtracting \( 81 \) from both sides:

\[ b^2 = 225 - 81 \]

Calculating the right side gives:

\[ b^2 = 144 \]

Now, take the square root of both sides to find \( b \):

\[ b = \sqrt{144} \]
\[ b = 12 \]

Thus, the height of the wall is **12 feet**."
"Sizes and measurement","Quantities in factual contexts","G","A rectangular garden has one side measuring 12 meters and a diagonal path that connects opposite corners; calculate the length of the diagonal path using the Pythagorean theorem.","To calculate the length of the diagonal path in a rectangular garden using the Pythagorean theorem, you'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Dimensions**: You already know one side of the rectangle is 12 meters. Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( b \). You'll need both the length and the width to use the Pythagorean theorem.

2. **Understand the Pythagorean Theorem**: The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (which is the diagonal path in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
   \[
   c^2 = a^2 + b^2
   \]
   where:
   - \( c \) is the length of the diagonal,
   - \( a \) is one side of the rectangle (12 meters),
   - \( b \) is the other side (the width).

3. **Specify the Other Side**: Since we are not given the length of the other side in your task, let’s assume hypothetically that the width (the other side, which we’ll denote as \( b \)) is a certain value. Let’s say it measures 9 meters (feel free to replace this with the actual width if you have it).

4. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**: Using the assumed width of 9 meters:
   \[
   c^2 = 12^2 + 9^2
   \]

5. **Calculate the Squares**:
   - Calculate \( 12^2 = 144 \)
   - Calculate \( 9^2 = 81 \)

6. **Sum the Squares**:
   \[
   c^2 = 144 + 81 = 225
   \]

7. **Calculate the Diagonal**:
   - To find \( c \), take the square root:
   \[
   c = \sqrt{225} = 15 \text{ meters}
   \]

Thus, if the width of the garden was 9 meters, the length of the diagonal path would be 15 meters.

If you have the actual width of the garden, simply replace the 9 in step 4 with the correct value and follow the same process to find the length of the diagonal path."

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]

where:
- \( c \) is the length of the hypotenuse,
- \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the other two legs.

In your case:
- One leg (let's call it \( a \)) is 8 inches.
- The hypotenuse (let's call it \( c \)) is 10 inches.
- We need to find the length of the other leg (let's call it \( b \)).

Now, you can plug in the values you have into the Pythagorean theorem:

\[ 8^2 + b^2 = 10^2 \]

Now calculate \( 8^2 \) and \( 10^2 \):

- \( 8^2 = 64 \)
- \( 10^2 = 100 \)

Now substitute those values into the equation:

\[ 64 + b^2 = 100 \]

Next, to isolate \( b^2 \), subtract 64 from both sides:

\[ b^2 = 100 - 64 \]
\[ b^2 = 36 \]

Now, take the square root of both sides to find \( b \):

\[ b = \sqrt{36} \]
\[ b = 6 \]

So, the length of the other leg is **6 inches**."

     - \( 435 + 160 = 595 \)
     - \( 595 + 155 = 750 \)
     - \( 750 + 175 = 925 \)
     - \( 925 + 130 = 1055 \)

   - Align one side of the angle along the baseline of the protractor (the straight edge at the bottom). Make sure that your line is straight and that the protractor is flat against the desk surface.

4. **Reading the Measurement**:
   - Look at the second line (the other side of the angle that isn't aligned with the baseline) and read where it intersects the degree markings on the protractor. Make sure to read it from the correct side (the inner or outer scale), depending on which direction the angle opens. 
   - Record the measurement in degrees. For example, if the line intersects at the 90-degree mark, then the angle is 90 degrees.

5. **Double-Checking**:
   - It can be helpful to measure again or use a different spot on the protractor to ensure your measurement is accurate. 

6. **Recording Your Results**:
   - Write down the angle measurement clearly along with any additional notes about the measurement (e.g., the date, location, or any deviations you might have encountered).

By following these steps carefully, you can accurately measure the angle at the corner of your classroom desk and record it in degrees."
"Sizes and measurement","Measuring and calculating","D","Find an everyday object in your home such as a book or a picture frame and estimate the angle formed at one of its corners then verify your estimation using a protractor.","To solve the task of estimating the angle at a corner of an everyday object in your home (like a book or a picture frame), you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Choose an Object
- Select an object that has a clear corner with a defined angle, such as:
  - A book
  - A picture frame
  - A piece of furniture (like a table or a shelf)

### Step 2: Observe and Estimate
- Look closely at one of the corners of the object you selected.
- Try to gauge the angle visually. You might consider it to be:
  - A right angle (90 degrees)
  - Acute (less than 90 degrees)
  - Obtuse (more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees)
- Make an estimation based on your understanding of common angles. For example, a standard picture frame typically has right angles (90 degrees), while a triangular object may have acute angles.

### Step 3: Use a Protractor to Verify
- **Prepare your tools**: Get a protractor, which is a tool used to measure angles.
- **Align the protractor**: Place the protractor so that the midpoint (the small hole) is directly over the corner you are measuring. Make sure that one side of the angle fits along the straight edge of the protractor.
- **Read the angle**: Look at where the other side of the angle lines up with the measurement marks on the protractor. This will give you the precise measurement.
  
### Step 4: Compare and Reflect
- Compare your estimated value with the actual measurement you obtained using the protractor.
- Reflect on what you observed: Was your estimate close? What helped you make your estimation? What surprised you about the actual angle?

### Additional Tips
- If you're not sure how to gauge angles, you can recall some common angles:
  - Right angle: forms a square corner (90 degrees)
  - Acute angle: smaller than a right angle (0-90 degrees)
  - Obtuse angle: larger than a right angle but smaller than a straight angle (90-180 degrees)
- If it's a large object and the angle is difficult to measure directly, you can use a piece of paper to mimic the angle or even draw the angles to help visualize.

This exercise not only helps with understanding angles but also hones your estimation and measurement skills!"

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","E","A pie chart shows the favorite fruits of 100 students: apples (25%) bananas (35%) oranges (20%) and grapes (20%); how many students chose bananas?","To solve the task about the pie chart showing the favorite fruits of 100 students, you need to calculate how many students chose bananas using the percentage given for bananas.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Understand the total number of students**: The total number of students is given as 100.

2. **Identify the percentage for bananas**: The pie chart indicates that 35% of the students chose bananas.

3. **Convert the percentage to a fraction**: To find out how many students chose bananas, you can convert the percentage into a decimal. This is done by dividing the percentage by 100:
   \[
   35\% = \frac{35}{100} = 0.35
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of students who chose bananas**: Multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of the percentage:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who chose bananas} = 0.35 \times 100
   \]

5. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   0.35 \times 100 = 35
   \]

So, **35 students** chose bananas. 

This method can be applied to find the number of students that chose any of the other fruits by using their respective percentages."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","E","If in a pie chart representing a class's activity participation 15% of students chose sports what is the percentage of students who didn’t choose sports if there are 40 students in total?","To solve the task of finding the percentage of students who didn't choose sports in a class of 40 students where 15% chose sports, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the percentage of students who chose sports**: You are given that 15% of the students chose sports.

2. **Calculate the percentage of students who did not choose sports**: To find the percentage of students who did not choose sports, subtract the percentage of students who chose sports from 100%. 

   \[
   \text{Percentage who didn't choose sports} = 100\% - \text{Percentage who chose sports}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Percentage who didn't choose sports} = 100\% - 15\% = 85\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students who didn't choose sports**: To find out how many students that represents in your class of 40 students, use the percentage you just calculated. You can find the number of students who didn’t choose sports by calculating 85% of the total number of students:

   \[
   \text{Number of students who didn't choose sports} = \text{Total students} \times \text{Percentage who didn't choose sports}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of students who didn't choose sports} = 40 \times 0.85 = 34
   \]

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","E","In a pie chart depicting the distribution of pets in a neighborhood dogs make up 40% and cats 30%; what proportion of pets do other animals represent if the total pets are 200?","To solve this task, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total percentages accounted for by dogs and cats**: You are given that dogs make up 40% of the pets and cats make up 30%. First, you need to add these two percentages together:
   \[
   40\% + 30\% = 70\%
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining percentage for other animals**: Since the total percentage must equal 100%, you can find the percentage of other animals by subtracting the sum of the percentages of dogs and cats from 100%:
   \[
   100\% - 70\% = 30\%
   \]

3. **Translate this percentage to the actual number of pets**: You know that the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 200. To find out how many pets represent the other animals, calculate 30% of 200:
   \[
   \text{Number of other animals} = 30\% \times 200 = \frac{30}{100} \times 200 = 60
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The proportion of pets that other animals represent is 60 pets.

In summary, other animals represent 30% of the pet population, which translates to 60 pets in a total of 200 pets."

### Step 1: Organize the Data

First, let's summarize the data you have:

- 0 books: 5 students
- 1 book: 8 students
- 2 books: 4 students
- 3 books: 3 students

### Step 2: Create the Frequency Table

Now, create a frequency table that organizes this information clearly. The table typically consists of two columns: one for the number of books read, and one for the frequency of students.

| Number of Books Read | Frequency |
|---------------------|-----------|
| 0                   | 5         |

1. **Total Students**: To confirm the total, we can add the frequencies: 
   \[
   5 + 8 + 4 + 3 = 20 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **Reading Habits**:
   - The table shows that the majority of students (8 students) read **1 book** in the past month. This suggests a trend that most students have minimal reading habits, as reading just one book indicates limited engagement.
   - There are 5 students who did not read any books at all, which reflects a lack of interest in reading among some students.
   - A smaller number of students read **2 books** (4 students) and only **3 books** (3 students), suggesting that while there is a portion of students who read more, they are in the minority.

### Step 4: Conclusions

The frequency table indicates that:
- A significant portion of the student population is not reading extensively, with a majority reading only one book.
- There is a small segment of students who are more engaged with reading (those reading 2 or 3 books).
- Overall, the data may indicate a need for promoting reading habits among students, as many are not reading beyond one book, and some are not reading at all.

### Final Step: Presentation

When presenting your findings, you can include the frequency table and summarize the patterns observed in students' reading habits. You may also want to suggest potential reasons for low reading engagement and ideas for increasing interest in reading, such as book clubs, reading challenges, or integrating reading more into their routine."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","G","Analyze the given stem-and-leaf plot representing the ages of students in a class to determine the mean age.","To calculate the mean age from a stem-and-leaf plot, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Stem-and-Leaf Plot**: A stem-and-leaf plot displays data where each number is split into a ""stem"" and a ""leaf."" For instance, if the stem is ""2"" and the leaf is ""3,"" that represents the age 23.

2. **Extract Data from the Plot**: List all the ages represented in the stem-and-leaf plot. For each entry, combine the stem and leaf to form the complete number. If the stems represent tens and the leaves represent units, for a stem of 2 and leaves of 1, 2, 3, you would have 21, 22, 23.

3. **Compile a Data List**: Write down all the ages in a list. For example, if the stem-and-leaf plot indicates the following:
   - Stem 2: 1 2 3 (represents ages 21, 22, 23)
   - Stem 3: 0 1 2 3 (represents ages 30, 31, 32, 33)
   You would compile the list: 21, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33.

4. **Calculate the Total Sum of Ages**: Add up all the ages in your list. 

   Example:  
   \( 21 + 22 + 23 + 30 + 31 + 32 + 33 = 192 \)

5. **Count the Number of Ages**: Determine how many ages are in your list.

   In this example, there are 7 ages.

6. **Calculate the Mean**: Use the formula for mean, which is the total sum of the ages divided by the number of ages.
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Ages}}{\text{Number of Ages}}
   \]

   For this example:
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{192}{7} \approx 27.43
   \]

7. **Interpret the Result**: Conclude your findings, noting that the mean age of the students is approximately 27.43 years.

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","G","From the stem-and-leaf plot that displays the scores of students on a math test find the median score.","To find the median score from a stem-and-leaf plot, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Stem-and-Leaf Plot**: A stem-and-leaf plot typically consists of two columns where the ""stem"" represents the leading digit(s) of the data and the ""leaf"" represents the trailing digit. For instance, a stem of 7 and a leaf of 5 would represent the score 75.

2. **List the Scores**: From the stem-and-leaf plot, you will need to write out all the scores represented in the plot. For every stem, you combine it with each of its corresponding leaves to form full scores.

3. **Organize the Scores**: Once you've compiled the full list of scores, make sure they are sorted in ascending order (from the lowest to the highest score). 

4. **Count the Number of Scores**: Determine how many scores are in your list. This will help you determine how to find the median.

5. **Find the Median**:
   - If the number of scores (n) is odd, the median is the middle score. You can find the middle score by using the formula: \( \text{Median Position} = \frac{n + 1}{2} \). So if there are 11 scores, the median would be the score in position 6 when arranged in order.
   - If the number of scores (n) is even, the median is the average of the two middle scores. You can find the middle positions using the formula: \( \text{Median Positions} = \frac{n}{2} \) and \( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \). For example, if there are 12 scores, you would average the scores in positions 6 and 7.

6. **Calculate the Median**: Identify the median score(s) from your ordered list based on whether you have an odd or even count, and then compute your final median.

Here's a brief example:

### Example:
Assume the stem-and-leaf data looks like this:

```
Stem | Leaf
------------
  7  | 2 5
  8  | 1 3 4 6
```

From this, the full scores are 72, 75, 81, 83, 84, and 86.

- Sorted scores: 72, 75, 81, 83, 84, 86 (total of 6 scores).
- Since there are 6 scores (even), find the median:
  - Middle positions: 6/2 = 3 and 4 (scores in positions 3 and 4 are 81 and 83).
  - Median = (81 + 83) / 2 = 82.

So, the median score in this example would be 82.

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Analyze the given histogram to determine whether the data is positively skewed negatively skewed or symmetric and explain your reasoning.","To analyze a histogram and determine whether the data is positively skewed, negatively skewed, or symmetric, you can follow these steps:

1. **Observe the Shape of the Histogram**: 
   - Look at how the bars of the histogram are distributed.
   - Skewness refers to the asymmetry in the distribution of the data.

2. **Identify Skewness**:
   - **Positively Skewed (Right Skewed)**: If the tail on the right side of the histogram is longer or fatter than the left side, the data is positively skewed. This means that most of the data points are concentrated on the left, with a few larger values stretching to the right.
   - **Negatively Skewed (Left Skewed)**: If the tail on the left side of the histogram is longer or fatter than the right side, the data is negatively skewed. Here, most data points are concentrated on the right, with a few smaller values stretching to the left.
   - **Symmetric**: If the histogram has a roughly uniform shape, where both sides mirror each other, it is considered symmetric. In this case, most data points are concentrated around the center of the distribution.

3. **Check for Outliers**: Sometimes, outliers can affect the appearance of skewness. If there are extreme values on either end, it may indicate skewness even if the main body of data appears more balanced.

4. **Consider the Central Tendency**: The position of the mean in relation to the median can provide additional insight:
   - In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is typically greater than the median.
   - In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is usually less than the median.
   - In a symmetric distribution, the mean and median are generally very close or equal.

5. **Summarize Your Findings**: After analyzing the shape of the histogram, note the characteristics you've observed. Clearly state whether you believe the data is positively skewed, negatively skewed, or symmetric based on your observations and reasoning.

### Example
For instance, if you see a histogram where the majority of bars are pushed towards the left with a long tail extending to the right, you would conclude that it is positively skewed. On the other hand, if most bars are on the right with a long tail extending to the left, it is negatively skewed. If both sides look balanced, it’s likely symmetric.

By methodically analyzing these aspects, you can make an informed assessment about the distribution of the data represented in the histogram."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Calculate the mean and median of the data represented in the histogram and discuss which measure of central tendency better represents the dataset.","To solve the task of calculating the mean and median from the data represented in a histogram and discussing which measure of central tendency better represents the dataset, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Histogram
- A histogram displays the frequency distribution of numerical data. The x-axis generally represents the range of values (bins), and the y-axis represents the frequency (count) of data points in each bin.

### Step 2: Prepare the Data
- From the histogram, note down the bins (ranges) and their corresponding frequencies. Suppose the bins are represented as [A, B), [B, C), [C, D), etc., the frequency represents how many data points fall into each bin.

### Step 3: Calculate the Mean
1. **Find the Midpoint of Each Bin**: For each bin, calculate the midpoint. The midpoint can be found using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Midpoint} = \frac{\text{Lower Bound} + \text{Upper Bound}}{2}
   \]
   For example, for the bin [A, B), the midpoint is (A + B) / 2.
  
2. **Multiply Each Midpoint by Its Frequency**: For each bin, multiply the midpoint by the frequency.
   \[
   Total = \sum(\text{Midpoint}_i \times \text{Frequency}_i)
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Frequency**: Add up all the frequencies to get the total number of data points.
   \[
   Total\ Frequency = \sum(\text{Frequency}_i)
   \]

4. **Calculate the Mean**: Divide the total from step 2 by the total frequency from step 3.
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{Total}{Total\ Frequency}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Median
1. **Find the Cumulative Frequency**: Create a cumulative frequency table based on the frequencies. This shows how many data points fall below each bin.

2. **Determine the Median Bin**: Find the median position, which is:
   \[
   \text{Median Position} = \frac{Total Frequency + 1}{2}
   \]
   Identify which bin contains this position by comparing it with the cumulative frequencies.

3. **Interpolate if Necessary**: If the median falls between two values in the median bin, you may need to interpolate to find the exact median value.

### Step 5: Discuss the Results
- Compare the mean and median. Consider the following:
  - **Skewness**: If the dataset is skewed (e.g., positively or negatively), the mean may be affected more than the median. In such cases, the median may be a better measure of central tendency because it better represents the midpoint of the data.
  - **Outliers**: If there are outliers in your data, they can significantly affect the mean, while the median remains stable.

### Conclusion
Summarize your findings by discussing whether the mean or median better represents the dataset based on your observations regarding skewness, outliers, and the overall distribution.

By following this structured approach, you will be able to calculate the mean and median from the histogram data and provide a thoughtful discussion on the most representative measure of central tendency."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Using the histogram provided identify the mode of the data and evaluate what this indicates about the most frequent occurrence in the dataset.","To solve the task of identifying the mode from a histogram and evaluating what it indicates about the dataset, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Histogram
- A histogram displays the frequency distribution of a dataset. The x-axis represents the data intervals (bins), while the y-axis shows the frequency (number of occurrences) for each bin.

### Step 2: Identify the Mode
- The mode is the value or values that occur most frequently in the dataset. In a histogram, it corresponds to the bin (or bins) with the highest bar(s).
- To find the mode:
  1. Look for the tallest bar(s) in the histogram.
  2. Note the corresponding interval(s) on the x-axis for these bar(s). This is where the mode is located.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Mode
- Once you have identified the mode, reflect on what this indicates about the dataset:
  - **Most Frequent Occurrence**: The mode tells you which value or range of values appears most often in your data. This can indicate a common trend, preference, or characteristic within the dataset.
  - **Skewness**: If there is a clear mode, it might signify where most of the data points cluster. If the data is multimodal (more than one peak), it might indicate that there are multiple trends or categories within your data.
  - **Contextual Insights**: Depending on the data being represented, the mode can provide insights into popular choices, typical values, or anomalies within the dataset.

### Step 4: Conclusion
- Summarize your findings, explaining the significance of the mode in the context of the data being analyzed. You may discuss how it relates to the overall distribution, whether it confirms expected patterns, and how it may guide future observations or decisions.

### Example
If you have a histogram representing the ages of individuals in a survey, and the tallest bar is between the ages of 20-30, you can conclude that the mode of the dataset is in that age range. This suggests that the majority of respondents are likely within that age group, indicating a demographic trend that could be important for marketers or policymakers.

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Understanding probabilities","H","Calculate the probability of drawing two specific cards a Queen of Spades and a Jack of Hearts one after the other from a full deck without replacement.","To calculate the probability of drawing two specific cards (the Queen of Spades and the Jack of Hearts) one after the other from a full deck of cards without replacement, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Composition of the Deck**: A standard deck of cards has 52 cards, consisting of 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades) and 13 ranks (Ace through King). 

2. **Define the Events**: We want to find the probability of drawing a Queen of Spades first and then a Jack of Hearts in two draws without replacement.

3. **Calculate the Probability of the First Draw**:
   - The probability of drawing the Queen of Spades on the first draw:
   \[
   P(\text{Queen of Spades}) = \frac{1}{52}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Probability of the Second Draw**:
   - After drawing the Queen of Spades, there are now 51 cards left in the deck.
   - The probability of drawing the Jack of Hearts after having drawn the Queen of Spades:
   \[
   P(\text{Jack of Hearts | Queen of Spades}) = \frac{1}{51}
   \]

5. **Combine the Probabilities**:
   - The combined probability of both events occurring (drawing the Queen of Spades first and then the Jack of Hearts) is the product of the individual probabilities:
   \[
   P(\text{Queen of Spades and then Jack of Hearts}) = P(\text{Queen of Spades}) \times P(\text{Jack of Hearts | Queen of Spades}) = \frac{1}{52} \times \frac{1}{51}
   \]

6. **Calculate the Final Result**:
   \[
   P(\text{Queen of Spades and then Jack of Hearts}) = \frac{1}{52 \times 51} = \frac{1}{2652}
   \]

Thus, the final probability of drawing a Queen of Spades followed by a Jack of Hearts from a full deck of cards without replacement is \(\frac{1}{2652}\)."

The order in which you choose the fruits doesn't matter since you're just interested in the selection of fruits for your salad.

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]

where:
- \(C(n, r)\) is the number of combinations (the number of ways to choose \(r\) items from \(n\) items),
- \(n\) is the total number of items (in this case, the total number of fruits you have, which is 5),
- \(r\) is the number of items to choose (in this case, you want to choose 2 fruits),
- \(n!\) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \(n\).

In your case, you want to calculate \(C(5, 2)\):

1. First, calculate the factorials:
   - \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\)
   - \(2! = 2 \times 1 = 2\)
   - \((5 - 2)! = 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\)

Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter, which is the case here since selecting Student A and Student B is the same as selecting Student B and Student A.

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the total number of items (in this case, 5 students).
- \( r \) is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2 representatives).
- \( n! \) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).

In this scenario:
- \( n = 5 \)
- \( r = 2 \)

Now, plug these values into the formula:

\[
C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 3!}
\]

Next, calculate each factorial:
- \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)

This is because the order in which the marbles are selected does not matter (i.e., selecting marble A and marble B is the same as selecting marble B and marble A).

In mathematical terms, the number of ways to choose \( r \) items from \( n \) items is given by the combination formula:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

Where:
- \( n \) is the total number of items (in this case, 5 marbles),
- \( r \) is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2 marbles),
- \( n! \) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).

For your task:

- \( n = 5 \) (total marbles)
- \( r = 2 \) (marbles to select)

Plugging these values into the combination formula gives:

\[
C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 3!}
\]

Now, calculate the factorials:

- \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)

Now plug these values back into the equation:

1. **Identify the Current Value and Depreciation Rate**: 
   - Current value (V0) = $20,000
   - Depreciation rate (r) = 15% per year = 0.15 (as a decimal)

2. **Calculate the Value After Each Year**: 
   The value of the car after one year can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = V_0 \times (1 - r)
   \]
   where \(V\) is the value after one year, \(V_0\) is the initial value, and \(r\) is the depreciation rate.

3. **Apply the Formula Year by Year**:
   - **After Year 1**:
     \[
     V_1 = 20000 \times (1 - 0.15) = 20000 \times 0.85 = 17000
     \]
   - **After Year 2**:
     \[
     V_2 = V_1 \times (1 - 0.15) = 17000 \times 0.85 = 14450
     \]
   - **After Year 3**:
     \[
     V_3 = V_2 \times (1 - 0.15) = 14450 \times 0.85 = 12282.50

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","C","Draw two sets of fruits that show the ratio of 3 apples to 2 oranges and then create a visual representation of the equivalent ratio of 6 apples to 4 oranges.","To solve your task, you’ll need to create two visual representations of the fruit ratios: one for the ratio of 3 apples to 2 oranges and another for the equivalent ratio of 6 apples to 4 oranges. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you visualize and draw these ratios:

### 1. Understanding the Ratios
- The ratio of **3 apples to 2 oranges** means that for every 3 apples, there are 2 oranges.
- The ratio of **6 apples to 4 oranges** is equivalent, as it can be simplified to **3 apples to 2 oranges** when you divide both numbers by 2.

### 2. Visualizing the First Ratio (3 Apples to 2 Oranges)

**Step 1: Gather Materials**
You can use paper and colored pencils or markers, or even a digital drawing tool. Choose a color for apples (e.g., red) and a different color for oranges (e.g., orange).

**Step 2: Draw the Apples**
- Draw **3 apples**. You can use simple circles or any apple shape you prefer. Color them in your chosen color for apples.

**Step 3: Draw the Oranges**
- Draw **2 oranges**. Again, use your chosen shape for oranges and color them accordingly.

**Step 4: Arrange the Fruits**
- Arrange these drawings in a way that visually represents the ratio (e.g., grouping the apples together and the oranges together).

### 3. Visualizing the Equivalent Ratio (6 Apples to 4 Oranges)

**Step 1: Draw the Apples**
- Draw **6 apples** using the same method you used for the first set. You can expand on the same design but add 3 more apples to the previous 3.

**Step 2: Draw the Oranges**
- Draw **4 oranges** using the same method and style as your first set, adding 2 more oranges to the previous 2.

**Step 3: Arrange the Fruits**
- Similar to your first representation, make sure to arrange these in a clear visual way that highlights the ratio of 6:4.

### 4. Labeling
- Consider labeling each set of fruits. For example, you could write **""3 Apples : 2 Oranges""** under the first drawing and **""6 Apples : 4 Oranges""** under the second drawing to clarify what each set represents.

### 5. Final Presentation
- Make sure both drawings are clear and visually distinct. You can add a border or background color to enhance the visual appeal.

### Conclusion
You have now created two visual representations of the ratios! The first set shows the ratio of 3 apples to 2 oranges, and the second set represents the equivalent ratio of 6 apples to 4 oranges. This method allows for an easy comparison between the two sets and helps illustrate the concept of equivalent ratios visually."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","C","If Jamie can read 4 books in 2 weeks create a bar graph to show how many books she would read in 6 weeks using equivalent ratios.","To solve the task of creating a bar graph that shows how many books Jamie would read in 6 weeks using equivalent ratios, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Rate of Reading

First, calculate how many books Jamie reads in one week. Since she reads 4 books in 2 weeks, you can find the weekly rate by dividing:

\[
\text{Books per week} = \frac{4 \text{ books}}{2 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ books/week}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Books Read in 6 Weeks

Next, use the weekly rate to calculate how many books she would read in 6 weeks:

\[
\text{Books in 6 weeks} = 2 \text{ books/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ books}
\]

### Step 3: Set Up the Ratios

You can express the reading rates as ratios. The ratio of books read to weeks could be represented as:

1. For 2 weeks: \( \frac{4 \text{ books}}{2 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \)
2. For 6 weeks: \( \frac{12 \text{ books}}{6 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \)

This demonstrates that the rate remains constant, reinforcing the concept of equivalent ratios.

### Step 4: Create the Bar Graph

Now that you have the data, you can create a bar graph. Here's how:

1. **Label the Axes**: 
   - The x-axis (horizontal) will represent the time in weeks (e.g., 0, 2, 4, 6).
   - The y-axis (vertical) will represent the number of books read (e.g., 0, 4, 8, 12).

2. **Plot the Points**: 
   - For 2 weeks, plot a point at (2, 4).
   - For 6 weeks, plot a point at (6, 12).

3. **Draw the Bars**: 
   - For each point, draw a bar. The bar for 2 weeks should rise to 4 books, and the bar for 6 weeks should rise to 12 books.
   - Optionally, you can choose to show a bar for each 2-week period (like 0 weeks, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks) if you want to illustrate the progression over time.

4. **Title the Graph**: Add a title to the graph, such as ""Books Read by Jamie Over Time"".

### Step 5: Analyze the Graph

Once completed, you can analyze the graph to see how Jamie's reading increases over time. This visual representation helps to clearly show the equivalent ratios and the total books read at different time intervals.

By following these steps, you can successfully create a bar graph that illustrates how many books Jamie reads over a period of 6 weeks with the use of equivalent ratios."

### Step 1: Gather Materials
- Collect 5 blue blocks and 3 yellow blocks. If you don’t have colored blocks, you can use any items with distinct colors or even draw blocks in different colors.

### Step 2: Build the Model
- Arrange the 5 blue blocks and 3 yellow blocks together in a clear set-up. You can place them in a straight line, form a rectangle, or stack them to create a visually appealing display. Make sure the number of each block color is clear so that it reflects the ratio of 5:3.

### Step 3: Identify the Ratio
- The original ratio of blue to yellow blocks is 5:3. This means for every 5 blue blocks, there are 3 yellow blocks.

### Step 4: Find an Equivalent Ratio
- To find an equivalent ratio, you can multiply both parts of the ratio by the same whole number. For example:
  - If you multiply both terms of 5:3 by 2, you get:
    - \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) (blue blocks)
    - \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) (yellow blocks)
  - This gives you the equivalent ratio of 10 blue blocks to 6 yellow blocks (10:6).

### Step 5: Illustrate the Equivalent Ratio
- To illustrate this new equivalent ratio, build another model with 10 blue blocks and 6 yellow blocks. Arrange them similarly to your first model, ensuring they are visually distinct and grouped correctly.

### Step 6: Optional Further Ratios
- You can continue to find more equivalent ratios by multiplying the original ratio by other whole numbers (e.g., 3:15 blue blocks and yellow blocks, or 4:12). Just ensure to demonstrate it visually as you did above.

### Conclusion
Now you have not only built the original ratio but also found and illustrated at least one equivalent ratio. This process helps understand ratios visually and reinforces the concept of equivalence in ratios. Remember, you can always change the numbers by using different multipliers to explore further!"
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Linear and other simple functions","D","Create a table of values for the linear function y = 2x + 3 then plot the points on a graph and describe the slope.","To solve the task of creating a table of values for the linear function \( y = 2x + 3 \), plotting the points, and describing the slope, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Table of Values

1. **Choose a range of x-values**: Select several x-values to create corresponding y-values. For a linear function, you might choose values from -3 to 3, for example.
2. **Calculate y-values**: Use the function \( y = 2x + 3 \) to calculate the y-value for each chosen x-value.

Here’s an example table of values:

|  x  |  y = 2x + 3  |
|-----|--------------|
| -3  | \( 2(-3) + 3 = -6 + 3 = -3 \) |
| -2  | \( 2(-2) + 3 = -4 + 3 = -1 \) |
| -1  | \( 2(-1) + 3 = -2 + 3 = 1 \)  |
|  0  | \( 2(0) + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3 \)    |
|  1  | \( 2(1) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \)    |
|  2  | \( 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7 \)    |
|  3  | \( 2(3) + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 \)    |

### Step 2: Plot the Points on a Graph

1. **Draw the axes**: On a piece of graph paper or using graphing software, draw a horizontal (x-axis) and a vertical (y-axis) line.
2. **Label the axes**: Label the x-axis and the y-axis with appropriate scales (e.g., -3 to 3 for x and -3 to 10 for y).
3. **Plot the points**: Plot each point from the table onto the graph. For example, the point (-3, -3) is where you move 3 units left (for -3 on the x-axis) and 3 units down (for -3 on the y-axis).

### Step 3: Describe the Slope

1. **Identify the slope from the equation**: The linear equation \( y = 2x + 3 \) is in the slope-intercept form, \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept. Here, the slope \( m = 2 \).
2. **Interpret the slope**: A slope of 2 means that for every 1 unit increase in \( x \), \( y \) increases by 2 units. This indicates a steep upward trend.

### Summary

- The created table of values shows pairs of \( x \) and \( y \) values calculated from the function.
- The plotted points on a graph illustrate the linear function's relationship and form a straight line.
- The slope of 2 indicates a consistent increase in the \( y \) value relative to the \( x \) value, representing a steep and positive linear relationship.

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Linear and other simple functions","D","A local gym charges a one-time registration fee of $20 and $10 per month; write the equation for the total cost (C) as a function of months (m) make a table of values and graph the function.","To solve this task, you want to express the total cost \( C \) of joining a gym as a function of the number of months \( m \) you stay registered. Here's how you can do that step by step:

### Step 1: Write the Equation

The total cost \( C \) can be described as:
- A one-time registration fee of $20.
- A monthly fee of $10 for each month.

The equation can thus be written as:
\[ C(m) = 20 + 10m \]
where:
- \( C(m) \) is the total cost as a function of the number of months \( m \).

### Step 2: Make a Table of Values

Next, create a table of values for \( m \) (the number of months) and \( C(m) \) (the total cost). You can choose a range of months, such as 0 to 6.

| Months (m) | Cost (C(m)) |
|------------|--------------|
| 0          | \( 20 + 10(0) = 20 \)  |
| 1          | \( 20 + 10(1) = 30 \)  |
| 2          | \( 20 + 10(2) = 40 \)  |
| 3          | \( 20 + 10(3) = 50 \)  |
| 4          | \( 20 + 10(4) = 60 \)  |
| 5          | \( 20 + 10(5) = 70 \)  |
| 6          | \( 20 + 10(6) = 80 \)  |

Now, the completed table would look like this:

| Months (m) | Cost (C(m)) |
|------------|--------------|
| 0          | 20           |
| 1          | 30           |

| 3          | 50           |
| 4          | 60           |
| 5          | 70           |
| 6          | 80           |

### Step 3: Graph the Function

To graph the function, follow these steps:

1. **Set up your graph:** 
   - Use a horizontal axis (x-axis) to represent the months \( m \).
   - Use a vertical axis (y-axis) to represent the cost \( C(m) \).

2. **Plot the points from your table:**
   - (0, 20)
   - (1, 30)
   - (2, 40)
   - (3, 50)
   - (4, 60)
   - (5, 70)
   - (6, 80)

3. **Draw the graph:**
   - After plotting the points, connect them with a straight line since the function is linear.

### Summary

You have written the equation \( C(m) = 20 + 10m \), created a table of values showing the cost for different numbers of months, and plotted the graph of the function. The graph will show a straight line that starts at 20 when \( m = 0 \) and has a slope of 10, indicating the increase in cost for each additional month."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Linear and other simple functions","D","If a bike rental shop charges $5 for the first hour and $2 for each additional hour find the linear function that represents the cost (C) based on hours (h) plot it and explain the meaning of the slope.","To solve the task of finding the linear function that represents the cost (C) based on hours (h) for a bike rental shop that charges $5 for the first hour and $2 for each additional hour, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Define the Cost Function

1. **First Hour**: The cost for the first hour is a flat fee of $5.
2. **Additional Hours**: For any hours beyond the first, each hour costs $2.

To express this in a piecewise function:
- For \( h = 1 \) (1 hour), the cost \( C(h) = 5 \).
- For \( h > 1 \) (more than 1 hour), the cost can be represented as:
  \[
  C(h) = 5 + 2(h - 1)
  \]
  This is because you start with $5 for the first hour, and for every additional hour beyond the first (which is \( h - 1 \)), you add $2.
  
### Step 2: Simplify the Function

Now, we can simplify the equation for \( h > 1 \):
\[
C(h) = 5 + 2h - 2 = 2h + 3 \quad \text{(for } h > 1\text{)}
\]

Thus, the complete cost function can be expressed in piecewise form as:
\[
C(h) = 
\begin{cases} 
5 & \text{if } h = 1 \\
2h + 3 & \text{if } h > 1 
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 3: Identify the Linear Function

The portion \( C(h) = 2h + 3 \) for \( h > 1 \) is in the format of a linear function, where:
- **Slope (m)** = 2
- **Y-intercept (b)** = 3

The function can be understood to start at $5 for the first hour and then increases by $2 for every additional hour.

### Step 4: Plot the Function

To plot the cost function:

1. **Create a table of values** for various hours:
   - \( h = 1, C(1) = 5 \)
   - \( h = 2, C(2) = 2(2) + 3 = 7 \)
   - \( h = 3, C(3) = 2(3) + 3 = 9 \)
   - \( h = 4, C(4) = 2(4) + 3 = 11 \)
   - Continue for other values as needed.

2. **Draw the axes**: On the x-axis, label it as ""Hours (h)"", and on the y-axis, label it as ""Cost (C)"".

3. **Plot the points** from the table and finally draw a line. The line will start at (1, 5) for the first hour and then increase steadily with a slope of 2 for any additional hours.

### Step 5: Explain the Meaning of the Slope

The slope of the linear function, which is \( m = 2 \), represents the rate of change of the cost with respect to time (in hours). This means that for every additional hour that you rent the bike after the first hour, the total cost increases by $2. In other words, the slope tells you how much more you will have to pay for each extra hour you rent the bike after the initial charge.

### Summary

The linear function that represents the cost of renting a bike, based on hours rented, is \( C(h) = 2h + 3 \) for \( h > 1 \), and the slope indicates that each additional hour of renting the bike costs $2. The initial cost before any extra hours are added is $5 for the first hour."

Solve for x in the equation x + 75 = 250.","To solve Maria's savings problem, you want to determine how much more money she needs to save to reach the total cost of the bike, which is $250. The amount she currently has is $75, and we can represent the additional amount she needs with the variable \( x \).

The equation given is:

\[
x + 75 = 250
\]

Here, \( x \) represents the amount of money Maria still needs to save. To solve for \( x \), follow these steps:

1. **Subtract 75 from both sides of the equation** to isolate \( x \):

   \[
   x + 75 - 75 = 250 - 75
   \]

   This simplifies to:

   \[
   x = 250 - 75
   \]

2. **Calculate the right side**: 

   \[
   250 - 75 = 175
   \]

So, \( x = 175 \).

This means that Maria needs to save **$175 more** to buy the bike. 

In summary, Maria has $75 and needs a total of $250, so by solving the equation, we find that she needs to save an additional $175."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Equations and algebra","E","The temperature outside is 20 degrees Celsius; if it increases by 15 degrees what will the new temperature be? Solve for x in the equation x - 15 = 20.","To solve the task you've presented, we can break it down into two parts: finding the new temperature after an increase, and solving the equation \( x - 15 = 20 \).

### Part 1: Finding the New Temperature
1. **Initial Temperature**: The temperature outside is initially 20 degrees Celsius.
2. **Increase in Temperature**: It is given that the temperature increases by 15 degrees.

To find the new temperature:
- New Temperature = Initial Temperature + Increase
- New Temperature = 20 degrees Celsius + 15 degrees Celsius = 35 degrees Celsius.

So, the new temperature will be 35 degrees Celsius.

### Part 2: Solving the Equation \( x - 15 = 20 \)
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) in the equation:

1. Start with the equation:
   \[
   x - 15 = 20
   \]
2. To isolate \( x \), add 15 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x - 15 + 15 = 20 + 15
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   x = 35
   \]

So, the solution for \( x \) is 35. 

### Conclusion
- The new temperature after the increase is **35 degrees Celsius**.
- The solution for the equation \( x - 15 = 20 \) is **35**. 

Both parts lead to the same numerical answer: 35."

1. The difference between the second term (7) and the first term (3):
   \[

   \]
   
2. The difference between the third term (13) and the second term (7):
   \[
   13 - 7 = 6
   \]

3. The difference between the fourth term (21) and the third term (13):
   \[
   21 - 13 = 8
   \]

Now we can summarize the differences:
- First difference: \(4\)
- Second difference: \(6\)
- Third difference: \(8\)

Next, let's look for a pattern in these differences. The differences appear to increase by \(2\) each time:
- From \(4\) to \(6\) is an increase of \(2\).
- From \(6\) to \(8\) is an increase of \(2\).

Therefore, the next term in the sequence \(3, 7, 13, 21\) is \(31\).

**Pattern Explanation:**
The sequence can be identified by noting that the differences between consecutive terms form an arithmetic sequence starting at \(4\) and increasing by \(2\) each time. Hence, the next difference (10) was added to the last term (21) to arrive at the next term (31).

1. **Identify the Starting Amount**: The initial balance of the savings account is $100.

2. **Determine the Monthly Increase**: Each month, the account increases by $15.

3. **Calculate the Total Increase After 6 Months**: Since the account increases by $15 each month, you can calculate the total increase after 6 months by multiplying the monthly increase by the number of months:

1. **Identify the pattern**: Look at the differences between consecutive terms in the sequence:
   - \(7 - 3 = 4\)
   - \(11 - 7 = 4\)
   - \(15 - 11 = 4\)

   The difference between each pair of consecutive terms is \(4\). This indicates that the sequence is an **arithmetic sequence** with a common difference of \(4\).

**Step 1: Find the 10th term (\(a_{10}\))**

The sequence is defined by the formula:
\[
a_n = 5n - 2
\]

To find the 10th term, substitute \(n = 10\) into the formula:
\[
a_{10} = 5(10) - 2
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
a_{10} = 50 - 2 = 48
\]

**Step 2: Find the sum of the first 5 terms**

First, we need to calculate the first 5 terms of the sequence by substituting \(n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\) into the formula. 

- For \(n = 1\):
  \[
  a_1 = 5(1) - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3
  \]

- For \(n = 2\):
  \[
  a_2 = 5(2) - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8
  \]

- For \(n = 3\):
  \[
  a_3 = 5(3) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13
  \]

- For \(n = 4\):
  \[
  a_4 = 5(4) - 2 = 20 - 2 = 18

Next, we find the sum of these terms:
\[

   \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups per cookie}
   \]

2. **Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies**: Next, multiply the amount of flour needed per cookie by the number of cookies you want to make (30 cookies):

   \[
   \text{Flour for 30 cookies} = 30 \text{ cookies} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups per cookie} = 5 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Conclusion**: You’ll need 5 cups of flour to make 30 cookies.

So the final answer is that you would need **5 cups of flour** to make 30 cookies."

1. **Understanding the Pattern**: 
   The 4 times table consists of the multiples of 4. Each number in the table is generated by multiplying 4 by the sequential integers. Here's how the first few multiples of 4 look:
   - 4 × 1 = 4
   - 4 × 2 = 8
   - 4 × 3 = 12
   - 4 × 4 = 16
   - 4 × 5 = 20
   - 4 × 6 = 24
   - 4 × 7 = 28
   - 4 × 8 = 32
   - 4 × 9 = 36

   The pattern is that each term increases by 4. 

2. **Identifying a General Rule**: 
   The nth term of the 4 times table can be represented mathematically as:
   \[
   T(n) = 4n
   \]
   where \( n \) is the integer you are multiplying 4 by (e.g., \( n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \)).

3. **Predicting the Product of 4 and 9**:
   To find the product of 4 and 9 using the identified pattern or rule, substitute \( n = 9 \) into the formula:
   \[
   T(9) = 4 \times 9
   \]

   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: 
   Thus, the product of 4 and 9 is 36. You can also verify this by checking the 9th term in the pattern you've identified, which confirms the result is consistent with the 4 times table. 

So, the final answer is \( 4 \times 9 = 36 \)."

1. **Understand the 5 Times Table**: The 5 times table is a sequence that results from multiplying 5 by different whole numbers. It starts like this:
   - 5 x 1 = 5
   - 5 x 2 = 10
   - 5 x 3 = 15
   - 5 x 4 = 20
   - 5 x 5 = 25
   - 5 x 6 = 30
   - and so on...

2. **Identify the Number 12**: To find 5 times 12, you want to see where 12 fits in relation to the multiples of 5. 

3. **Break It Down**: Since the 5 times table goes in increments of 5, you can think about finding the multiple just below or around 12. 
   - You know that 5 x 2 = 10 and 5 x 3 = 15. This tells you that 12 is between 10 and 15.

4. **Use the Known Products**: Since you know:
   - 5 x 2 = 10
   - 5 x 3 = 15
   You can average these or frame it within a larger multiplication. Noticing that 12 is 2 more than 10, you can express 5 times 12 as follows:
   - 5 x 12 = 5 x (10 + 2)  (since 12 is 10 + 2)
   - This is equal to 5 x 10 + 5 x 2.
   - We know that 5 x 10 = 50 and 5 x 2 = 10.

5. **Calculate the Product**: Now you can add those results together:
   - 50 + 10 = 60.

Thus, 5 times 12 equals 60.

By visualizing the 5 times table, breaking down the multiplication, and using already known products, you can quickly and easily find that 5 x 12 = 60."

Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Define the Variables**:
   - Let \( n \) be the cost of the notebook.
   - We are told that the pencil costs $2 less than the notebook, so we can express the cost of the pencil \( p \) as:
     \[
     p = n - 2
     \]

2. **Set Up the Total Cost Equation**:
   - We know that together, the cost of the pencil and the notebook is $6. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     p + n = 6
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for \( p \)**:
   - Now, we can replace \( p \) in the total cost equation with the expression we found earlier:
     \[
     (n - 2) + n = 6
     \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     2n - 2 = 6
     \]

5. **Solve for \( n \)**:
   - To isolate \( n \), first add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     2n = 8
     \]
   - Then, divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     n = 4
     \]

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","D","Plot the points (2 4) (3 6) (4 8) and (5 10) on a coordinate grid and identify the constant of proportionality.","To solve the task of plotting the points (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8), and (5, 10) on a coordinate grid and identifying the constant of proportionality, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Coordinate System

A coordinate grid consists of two perpendicular lines (axes):
- The **horizontal axis** (x-axis) represents the first number in the ordered pair (x-value).
- The **vertical axis** (y-axis) represents the second number in the ordered pair (y-value).

### Step 2: Set Up the Coordinate Grid

1. Draw a horizontal line for the x-axis and a vertical line for the y-axis. The point where they intersect is called the origin (0, 0).
2. Label the axes with appropriate values. Ensure the values cover at least the range of x (2 to 5) and y (4 to 10).

### Step 3: Plotting the Points

1. **Plot (2, 4)**: Start at the origin. Move 2 units right on the x-axis and then move 4 units up. Mark this point.
2. **Plot (3, 6)**: From the origin, move 3 units right and then 6 units up. Mark this point.
3. **Plot (4, 8)**: From the origin, move 4 units right and then 8 units up. Mark this point.
4. **Plot (5, 10)**: From the origin, move 5 units right and then 10 units up. Mark this point.

### Step 4: Connect the Points

You can draw straight lines connecting the points if you wish, but it is not mandatory. The points will likely form a straight line, suggesting a proportional relationship.

### Step 5: Identify the Constant of Proportionality

The constant of proportionality (k) can be found by looking at the relationship between x and y values in the ordered pairs. 

1. You can see that as x increases, y increases consistently. To find the constant of proportionality, use the formula:
   
   \( y = kx \)

   Rearranging gives:

   \( k = \frac{y}{x} \)

2. Calculate \( k \) for one of the points (you can verify it works for all):

   - For (2, 4):
     \[
     k = \frac{4}{2} = 2
     \]

   - For (3, 6):
     \[
     k = \frac{6}{3} = 2

   - For (4, 8):
     \[
     k = \frac{8}{4} = 2
     \]

   - For (5, 10):
     \[
     k = \frac{10}{5} = 2
     \]

### Conclusion

The constant of proportionality is **2**, meaning that for each unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units. The relationship is linear and proportional, represented by the equation \( y = 2x \).

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","D","If a recipe requires 4 cups of flour to make 8 cookies graph the points (8 4) and (16 8) to represent the relationship and find the constant of proportionality.","To solve this task, you need to analyze the relationship between the number of cookies and the amount of flour required in the recipe. Here’s how you can approach it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Task**:
   - The recipe states that **4 cups of flour** are required to make **8 cookies**.
   - This means we can establish a relationship between the number of cookies (x) and the amount of flour (y).

2. **Identifying Points**:
   - The first point given is (8, 4), where 8 is the number of cookies and 4 is the cups of flour.
   - The second point given is (16, 8), where 16 cookies require 8 cups of flour. Since doubling the number of cookies (from 8 to 16) also doubles the amount of flour (from 4 to 8), this point makes sense in a proportional relationship.

3. **Finding the Constant of Proportionality**:
   - The constant of proportionality (k) can be found using the formula:
     \[
     k = \frac{y}{x}
     \]
     where \( y \) is the amount of flour and \( x \) is the number of cookies.
   - For the first point (8, 4):
     \[
     k = \frac{4 \text{ cups of flour}}{8 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ cups of flour per cookie}
     \]
   - For the second point (16, 8):
     \[
     k = \frac{8 \text{ cups of flour}}{16 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ cups of flour per cookie}
     \]
   - Since both points yield the same constant of proportionality, this confirms the relationship is linear.

4. **Graphing the Points**:
   - You can now graph the points (8, 4) and (16, 8) on a coordinate plane.
   - On the x-axis, represent the number of cookies, and on the y-axis, represent the cups of flour.
   - Plot the point (8, 4), then plot the point (16, 8).
   - Draw a line through these points to illustrate the linear relationship.

5. **Interpreting the Graph**:
   - The straight line represents the relationship between the number of cookies and the amount of flour.
   - The slope of the line indicates the constant of proportionality, in this case, showing that for every cookie, you need \( \frac{1}{2} \) cup of flour.

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","D","Write a proportional equation for the points (1 2) (2 4) (3 6) and then plot these points on a coordinate grid to visualize the relationship.","To solve the task of writing a proportional equation for the given points (1, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 6), and then plotting them on a coordinate grid, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Relationship
A proportional relationship means that one quantity is a constant multiple of another. The points you provided are:
- (1, 2)
- (2, 4)
- (3, 6)

To determine the relationship, look at how the y-values change as the x-values change.

For each point, you can determine the ratio of y to x:
- For (1, 2): \( \frac{2}{1} = 2 \)
- For (2, 4): \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \)
- For (3, 6): \( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \)

Since the ratio \(\frac{y}{x} = 2\) is constant, you can conclude that there is a proportional relationship. 

### Step 2: Write the Proportional Equation
The proportional equation can be expressed in the form:
\[ y = kx \]
where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

From our calculations, since \( k = 2 \), the equation is:
\[ y = 2x \]

### Step 3: Plot the Points 
To visualize the relationship with the coordinate grid, follow these steps:

1. **Draw the axes**: Draw x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical).
2. **Label the axes**: Mark the increments on both axes (suitable for the values, e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. on the x-axis and 0, 2, 4, 6, etc. on the y-axis).
3. **Plot the points**:
   - Plot (1, 2): Go to x = 1 and y = 2, place a point there.
   - Plot (2, 4): Go to x = 2 and y = 4, place a point there.
   - Plot (3, 6): Go to x = 3 and y = 6, place a point there.
4. **Draw the line**: Since this is a linear relationship, you can connect the points with a straight line. This line should continue through the origin (0,0) since proportional relationships always intersect at the origin.

### Step 4: Analyze the Graph
You should see a straight line passing through the points (1, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 6), confirming the proportional relationship expressed by the equation \(y = 2x\). The line indicates that for every increase of 1 in x, y increases by 2, illustrating their proportionality visually.

By following these steps, you can effectively write the proportional equation and plot the points on a coordinate grid!"

Let's break down the details:

1. You saved $200 for a new bike.
2. The cost of the bike is $50 more than what you currently have.

Let's denote the amount of money you originally had as \( x \). According to the problem, the cost of the bike can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Cost of the bike} = x + 50 \]

Since you saved $200 for the bike, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 200 = x + 50 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   200 - 50 = x
   \]

   This simplifies to:

   \[
   150 = x
   \]

So, \( x = 150 \).

This means you originally had $150. You can check your answer by calculating the cost of the bike:

- If you originally had $150, then the bike costs \( 150 + 50 = 200 \).
- Since you have saved $200, you can indeed afford the bike.

In conclusion, you originally had **$150**."

### Step 1: Identify the Common Ratio
In a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant number called the common ratio (\(r\)). To find the common ratio, divide any term by the term that comes before it.

1. **From 3 to 6**:
   \[
   r = \frac{6}{3} = 2
   \]

2. **From 6 to 12**:
   \[
   r = \frac{12}{6} = 2
   \]

3. **From 12 to 24**:
   \[
   r = \frac{24}{12} = 2
   \]

Since the common ratio is consistent throughout (2 in all cases), we can conclude that the common ratio is \(r = 2\).

### Step 2: Predict the Next Two Terms
To find the next terms in the sequence, multiply the last known term by the common ratio.

1. **Finding the fifth term**:
   \[
   24 \times 2 = 48
   \]

2. **Finding the sixth term**:

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Other functional relationships","G","A car's value decreases by half each year; if its current value is $16000 what will the value be after 3 years in a geometric sequence?","To solve the problem of finding the value of a car after 3 years, we can model the situation with a geometric sequence.

### Understanding the Problem
1. **Initial Value**: The current value of the car is $16,000.
2. **Depreciation Rate**: The car's value decreases by half each year, meaning that after one year, it will be worth half of its value from the previous year.

### Geometric Sequence Setup
A geometric sequence can be described by the formula:
\[
a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)}
\]
Where:
- \( a_n \) is the value of the car after \( n \) years.
- \( a_1 \) is the initial value of the car.
- \( r \) is the common ratio (in this case, it will be \( \frac{1}{2} \) since the value halves).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

### Substituting Values
- The initial value \( a_1 = 16000 \).
- The common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{2} \).
- We want to find the value after \( n = 3 \) years.

### Calculation
Substituting the known values into the formula:
\[
a_3 = 16000 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{(3-1)} = 16000 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}
\]
Calculating the exponent:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Now plug this back into the equation:
\[
a_3 = 16000 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 16000 \div 4 = 4000
\]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the value of the car after 3 years will be **$4,000**. 

This can also be validated by calculating the value year by year:
- After 1 year: \( 16000 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 8000 \)
- After 2 years: \( 8000 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 4000 \)
- After 3 years: \( 4000 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 2000 \)

So the final value after 3 years is indeed **$2000**.

### Summary
1. Identify the initial value and the rate of depreciation.
2. Set up the geometric sequence formula.
3. Perform calculations step-by-step to find the value after the desired number of years. The car's value will be $2,000 after 3 years."

\]

where:
- \( a_n \) is the \( n \)-th term,
- \( a_1 \) is the first term,
- \( r \) is the common ratio,
- \( n \) is the term number.

In your case:
- The first term \( a_1 = 5 \),
- The common ratio \( r = 3 \),
- You are looking for the fifth term, so \( n = 5 \).

Now, plug these values into the formula:

\[
a_5 = 5 \cdot 3^{(5-1)}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a_5 = 5 \cdot 3^4
\]

Next, calculate \( 3^4 \):

\[
3^4 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 81

### Step 1: Create the Table of Values
1. **Choose values of \(x\)**: We'll take \(x\) values from -2 to 2, which are: -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.
2. **Calculate corresponding \(y\) values**: For each \(x\) value, substitute it into the equation \(y = 3x + 2\) and calculate \(y\).

Let's compute the values:

- For \(x = -2\):
  \[
  y = 3(-2) + 2 = -6 + 2 = -4
  \]

- For \(x = -1\):
  \[

|   0   |   2   |
|   1   |   5   |
|   2   |   8   |

### Step 2: Graph the Function on a Coordinate Plane
1. **Draw the axes**: On a coordinate plane, draw a horizontal axis (the x-axis) and a vertical axis (the y-axis). Label them accordingly.

2. **Choose a scale**: Decide on a scale that fits all the \(x\) and \(y\) values you calculated. For example, each unit on the x-axis could represent 1 unit, and on the y-axis, you might use a similar scale.

3. **Plot the points**: Use the table to plot the points:

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Linear and other simple functions","D","A local bakery sells muffins for $2 each and cookies for $1.50 each; write a linear equation representing the total cost \(y\) for buying \(x\) muffins and then generate values for \(x\) from 0 to 4 to graph this equation.","To solve this task, you'll want to establish a linear equation that represents the total cost \(y\) based on the number of muffins \(x\) you buy. Given that muffins cost $2 each and cookies cost $1.50 each, you need to decide whether you're simply representing the cost of muffins or including cookies as well.

### Step 1: Create the Linear Equation

Since we only have the cost of muffins \(x\) and we can assume cookies are not included for this specific equation, you can model the total cost with just the muffins. Assuming no cookies are being purchased, your equation for the cost \(y\) for buying \(x\) muffins will be:

\[
y = 2x
\]

This means:
- \(y\) is the total cost in dollars.
- \(x\) is the number of muffins bought.
- Each muffin costs $2, so the equation reflects that.

If you also wanted to account for cookies, the equation would change depending on how many cookies \(c\) you are buying. For example:

\[
y = 2x + 1.5c
\]

But for this specific task focusing on muffins only, we stick with \(y = 2x\).

### Step 2: Generate Values

Next, generate values for \(x\) from 0 to 4 and calculate the corresponding \(y\) values:

- For \(x = 0\):  
  \(y = 2(0) = 0\)

- For \(x = 1\):  
  \(y = 2(1) = 2\)

- For \(x = 2\):  
  \(y = 2(2) = 4\)

- For \(x = 3\):  
  \(y = 2(3) = 6\)

- For \(x = 4\):  
  \(y = 2(4) = 8\)

### Step 3: Create a Table of Values

Now, you can create a table to summarize these values:

| \(x\) (muffins) | \(y\) (total cost) |
|------------------|---------------------|
| 0                | 0                   |
| 1                | 2                   |
| 2                | 4                   |
| 3                | 6                   |
| 4                | 8                   |

### Step 4: Graph the Equation

To graph the equation \(y = 2x\):

1. Plot the points from the table on a coordinate axis where the x-axis represents the number of muffins and the y-axis represents the total cost.
2. Connect the points with a straight line; this will give you a linear graph representing the total cost of buying muffins.

### Conclusion

That’s how you create and graph the linear equation representing the total cost of muffins from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 4\). If you want to include cookies or any additional costs in the future, you can modify the equation accordingly."

### Step 1: Understand the formula
The formula given for converting Celsius (C) to Fahrenheit (F) is:
\[
F = 9C + 32
\]
This means that to find the temperature in Fahrenheit, you multiply the Celsius temperature by 9 and then add 32.

### Step 2: Create a table of values
You need to create a table where you will calculate the Fahrenheit values for the given Celsius temperatures: 0, 10, 20, and 30.

1. **For C = 0:**
   \[
   F = 9(0) + 32 = 0 + 32 = 32
   \]
   
2. **For C = 10:**
   \[
   F = 9(10) + 32 = 90 + 32 = 122
   \]
   
3. **For C = 20:**
   \[
   F = 9(20) + 32 = 180 + 32 = 212
   \]
   
4. **For C = 30:**
   \[
   F = 9(30) + 32 = 270 + 32 = 302
   \]

Now, you can create your table:

| Celsius (C) | Fahrenheit (F) |
|-------------|----------------|
| 0           | 32             |
| 10          | 122            |
| 20          | 212            |
| 30          | 302            |

### Step 3: Plot the corresponding Fahrenheit values
To plot these values:

1. **Set up your axes:**
   - Label the x-axis as ""Celsius (C)""
   - Label the y-axis as ""Fahrenheit (F)""

2. **Plot the points:**
   - For \(C = 0\), \(F = 32\) → Point (0, 32)
   - For \(C = 10\), \(F = 122\) → Point (10, 122)
   - For \(C = 20\), \(F = 212\) → Point (20, 212)
   - For \(C = 30\), \(F = 302\) → Point (30, 302)

3. **Draw the graph:**
   - You can use graph paper, plotting software, or online graphing tools. Place the points corresponding to each Celsius temperature and draw a line connecting them (if you're showing the relationship as continuous), or leave them as individual points.

### Step 4: Analyze your results
You can observe how Fahrenheit increases as Celsius increases and note the linearity of the relationship. The graph should show a straight line indicating a direct relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

This completes the task of creating a table and plotting the corresponding Fahrenheit values based on the Celsius measurements provided."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Equations and algebra","F","Solve for x: 3(x - 4) = 2(x + 5).","To solve the equation \( 3(x - 4) = 2(x + 5) \), follow these steps:

1. **Distribute the coefficients on both sides**:
   - On the left side: \( 3(x - 4) \) becomes \( 3x - 12 \).
   - On the right side: \( 2(x + 5) \) becomes \( 2x + 10 \).

   Now the equation looks like this:
   \[
   3x - 12 = 2x + 10
   \]

2. **Isolate the variable \( x \)**:
   - Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to get all the \( x \) terms on one side:
   \[
   3x - 2x - 12 = 10
   \]
   Which simplifies to:
   \[
   x - 12 = 10
   \]
   
3. **Add 12 to both sides** to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x - 12 + 12 = 10 + 12
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   x = 22
   \]

4. **Check your solution** by substituting \( x = 22 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(22 - 4) = 2(22 + 5)
   \]
   Simplifying both sides:
   - Left: \( 3(18) = 54 \)
   - Right: \( 2(27) = 54 \)

   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 22 \) is indeed the correct solution.

So, the solution to the equation \( 3(x - 4) = 2(x + 5) \) is \( x = 22 \)."

1. **Write down the equation**: You already have it as \( 12y = 4y + 48 \).

2. **Isolate the variable**: Start by getting all the terms containing \( y \) on one side of the equation. You can do this by subtracting \( 4y \) from both sides:
   \[
   12y - 4y = 4y + 48 - 4y
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8y = 48
   \]

3. **Solve for \( y \)**: To find the value of \( y \), divide both sides of the equation by 8:
   \[
   y = \frac{48}{8}
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   y = 6
   \]

4. **Interpret the solution**: The solution \( y = 6 \) means that the school would need to sell 6 items to reach the fundraising target as described in the equation.

So, the final answer is \( y = 6 \)."

1. **Define Variables**: Let's define a variable for the number of apples Alex has. We'll use \( x \) to represent the number of apples that Alex has.

2. **Express Jamie's Apples**: According to the problem, Jamie has twice as many apples as Alex. Therefore, if Alex has \( x \) apples, then Jamie has \( 2x \) apples.

3. **Set Up the Equation**: The problem states that together they have 36 apples. This can be written as an equation:
   \[
   \text{(Alex's apples)} + \text{(Jamie’s apples)} = 36
   \]
   Substituting the expressions we have for their apples:
   \[
   x + 2x = 36
   \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**: Now, combine the like terms on the left side of the equation:
   \[
   3x = 36
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**: To find out how many apples Alex has, divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   x = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: Alex has 12 apples.

To check, if Alex has 12 apples, then Jamie has:
\[
2x = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples.}
\]
Together, they have:
\[
12 + 24 = 36 \text{ apples,}
\]
which confirms our solution is correct. 

So, **Alex has 12 apples**."

1. On Day 1, the bakery produces 10 loaves.
2. On Day 2, the bakery increases production by 5 loaves, leading to \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) loaves.
3. On Day 3, the production again increases by 5, leading to \( 15 + 5 = 20 \) loaves.
4. Continuing this pattern, we can see the daily production is as follows:
   - Day 1: 10 loaves
   - Day 2: 15 loaves
   - Day 3: 20 loaves
   - Day 4: 25 loaves
   - Day 5: 30 loaves
   - Day 6: 35 loaves
   - Day 7: 40 loaves

From the pattern we can recognize that on day \( n \), the number of loaves produced forms an arithmetic sequence where:
- The first term (\( a_1 \)) is 10 (the production on day 1).
- The common difference (\( d \)) is 5 (the increase in production each day).

The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \cdot d
\]
Substituting in the values for \( a_1 \) and \( d \):
\[
a_n = 10 + (n - 1) \cdot 5
\]

Now, simplify the equation:
\[
a_n = 10 + 5n - 5
\]
\[
a_n = 5n + 5
\]

This is the formula to express the number of loaves produced on day \( n \).

Next, we can use the formula to find the number of loaves produced on day 7:
\[
a_7 = 5(7) + 5
\]
\[
a_7 = 35 + 5
\]
\[
a_7 = 40
\]

So, the total number of loaves produced on day 7 is **40 loaves**."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Recognizing patterns and structures","G","The cost of a monthly gym membership starts at $20 and increases by $5 for each additional family member; write an algebraic expression for the total cost based on the number of members and calculate the cost for a family of 4.","To solve this task, we'll break it down into two parts: formulating the algebraic expression for the total cost based on the number of family members and calculating the cost for a specific number of family members (in this case, 4).

### Step 1: Formulating the Algebraic Expression

1. **Identify the Fixed Cost**: The base cost for one member is $20.
   
2. **Identify the Incremental Cost**: Each additional family member adds $5 to the cost. If you have more than one member, the first member still costs $20, but each additional member will increase the cost.

3. **Define Variables**: Let \( n \) represent the number of family members.

4. **Construct the Expression**:
   - The first family member will always have a cost of $20.
   - Each additional family member costs an extra $5. If there are \( n - 1 \) additional family members (because the first member is the starting point), the cost contributed by them will be \( 5(n - 1) \).

Putting this together, the total cost \( C \) can be expressed as:
\[
C = 20 + 5(n - 1)
\]
This can be simplified to:
\[
C = 20 + 5n - 5
\]
\[
C = 5n + 15
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Cost for a Family of 4

1. **Substitute the Number of Members**: For a family of 4, substitute \( n = 4 \) into the expression \( C = 5n + 15 \).
   
2. **Calculate**:
\[
C = 5(4) + 15
\]
\[
C = 20 + 15
\]
\[
C = 35
\]

### Conclusion

Therefore, the algebraic expression for the total cost of the gym membership based on the number of family members is:
\[
C = 5n + 15
\]

For a family of 4 members, the total cost would be **$35**."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Recognizing patterns and structures","G","A car rental company charges a base fee of $30 plus $15 for each day the car is rented; create an algebraic formula for the total cost in terms of the number of days \( d \) the car is rented and determine the cost for renting the car for 3 days.","To solve this task, you need to create an algebraic formula based on the information provided about the car rental company's pricing structure.

1. **Identify the components of the cost**:
   - The base fee for renting the car: $30
   - The cost per day of rental: $15 per day

2. **Define the variable**:
   - Let \( d \) represent the number of days the car is rented.

3. **Create the algebraic formula**:
   - The total cost, \( C \), can be expressed as the sum of the base fee and the variable cost for the number of days rented. The variable cost will be the daily rate multiplied by the number of days.
   - The formula will look like this:
   \[
   C = 30 + 15d
   \]

4. **Use the formula to calculate the cost for 3 days**:
   - Substitute \( d = 3 \) into the formula:
   \[
   C = 30 + 15(3)
   \]
   - Now perform the calculation:
   \[
   C = 30 + 45 = 75
   \]

Thus, the cost for renting the car for 3 days is **$75**. 

In summary:
- The algebraic formula for the total cost is \( C = 30 + 15d \).
- The cost for renting the car for 3 days is $75."
