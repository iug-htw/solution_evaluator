You can express this calculation as:

Total Cost = Number of Packs × Cost per Pack

In this case, you have:

- Number of Packs = 4
- Cost per Pack = $24

You can set up the equation as follows:

Total Cost = 4 × $24

To use the distributive property, you can break down the $24 as follows:

$24 = $20 + $4

Now you can distribute the 4 across the two parts of $24:

Total Cost = 4 × ($20 + $4)

Using the distributive property, distribute the 4:

Total Cost = (4 × $20) + (4 × $4)

Now calculate both parts:

1. 4 × $20 = $80
2. 4 × $4 = $16

"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","A gardener needs to plant 29 flowers in rows of 3; apply the distributive property to calculate the total number of flowers he needs to plant.","To solve the task of how many flowers the gardener needs to plant in rows of 3 using the distributive property, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: The gardener needs to plant a total of 29 flowers in rows, where each row contains 3 flowers.

2. **Set Up the Equation**: You can express the total number of flowers as a multiplication of the number of rows (let's call it \( r \)) and the number of flowers per row, which is 3. This gives you the equation:
   \[
   3r = 29
   \]

3. **Use the Distributive Property**: The distributive property states that \( a(b + c) = ab + ac \). In this case, you'll set up the equation to find how many rows of 3 flowers can be made and the remainder.

   Rearranging the equation into a form that emphasizes the total can be helpful, although the distributive property isn't strictly necessary here. However, for the sake of demonstration, we can think of splitting the total into manageable parts. 

   You can express 29 as \( 27 + 2 \) (which is \( 3 \times 9 + 2 \)). So, we can think of the task as follows:

   \[
   29 = 3 \times 9 + 2
   \]

4. **Calculate Rows and Remainder**:
   - First, calculate how many complete rows you can fill with 3 flowers:
   \[
   3 \times 9 = 27 \quad (\text{which corresponds to 9 complete rows})
   \]
   - After filling 9 rows with 3 flowers, this uses up 27 flowers, leaving:
   \[
   29 - 27 = 2
   \]  
   flowers remaining.

5. **Conclude**: The gardener will be able to plant 9 complete rows of 3 flowers (which totals to 27 flowers), and then he will have 2 additional flowers left over that won't fill a complete row. 

So, using the distributive property helped us break down the total into manageable components, allowing us to easily see how many complete rows can be created and how many flowers remain after that.

Overall, the gardener will plant a total of 29 flowers consisting of:
- 9 rows of 3 flowers each (27 flowers) 
- Plus 2 flowers that are extra. 

If the context allows for partial rows (e.g., placing the additional flowers separately), he can consider those an additional partial row. 

Thus, in total:
- 9 rows can be fully formed, and he has 2 flowers left over."

When we say the submarine is at a depth of 150 meters, we can represent this as -150 meters (as depths below sea level are often represented as negative values).

1. Start with the initial depth of the submarine:
   \[
   \text{Initial Depth} = -150 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. The submarine is rising, which means you need to add the distance it rises (75 meters) to its current depth. Since rising reduces the absolute depth (or gets it closer to sea level), you will be adding a positive value:
   \[
   \text{New Depth} = \text{Initial Depth} + \text{Rise}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Depth} = -150 \text{ meters} + 75 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. Now perform the calculation:
   \[
   \text{New Depth} = -150 + 75 = -75 \text{ meters}
   \]

So, after rising 75 meters, the new depth of the submarine is **75 meters below sea level**."

1. **Understand the Initial Position**: Start by determining the starting point, which is sea level. In this context, sea level is usually considered 0 meters.

2. **Calculate the Ascent**: The climber ascends 200 meters. This means the elevation increases by 200 meters:
   \[
   \text{Elevation after ascent} = 0 \, \text{meters} + 200 \, \text{meters} = 200 \, \text{meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Descent**: The climber then descends 50 meters. This means you need to subtract 50 meters from the elevation after the ascent:
   \[
   \text{Elevation after descent} = 200 \, \text{meters} - 50 \, \text{meters} = 150 \, \text{meters}

Here's a step-by-step guide using two of the most common methods: the prime factorization method and the multiplication method.

### Method 1: Prime Factorization

1. **Find the Prime Factorization of Each Number**:
   - 8 can be factored into primes: 
     \[
     8 = 2^3
     \]
   - 12 can be factored into primes:
     \[
     12 = 2^2 \times 3^1
     \]

2. **Identify All Unique Prime Factors**:
   In this case, the unique prime factors are 2 and 3.

3. **Determine the Highest Power of Each Prime Factor**:
   - For the prime factor 2: The highest power from both numbers is \(2^3\) (from 8).
   - For the prime factor 3: The highest power is \(3^1\) (from 12).

4. **Multiply These Highest Powers Together**:
   \[

You can use either method to find the LCM, and both will lead you to the same result of 24. This means that if you were to continue generating multiples of 8 and 12, the first time they would both yield the same multiple is at 24."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 30 to understand their largest shared factor.","To calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 30, you can follow these steps:

### Method 1: Prime Factorization

1. **Find the prime factors of each number:**
   - For 20:
     - \( 20 = 2 \times 10 \)
     - \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \)
     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 20 is \( 2^2 \times 5^1 \).

   - For 30:
     - \( 30 = 3 \times 10 \)
     - \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \)
     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 30 is \( 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \).

2. **Identify the common prime factors:**
   - The prime factors of 20 are \( 2^2 \) and \( 5^1 \).
   - The prime factors of 30 are \( 2^1 \), \( 3^1\), and \( 5^1 \).
   - The common prime factors are \( 2^1 \) and \( 5^1 \).

3. **Choose the lowest power of each common factor:**
   - For \( 2 \), the lowest power is \( 2^1 \).
   - For \( 5 \), the lowest power is \( 5^1 \).

4. **Multiply the common factors together to get the GCD:**
   - GCD = \( 2^1 \times 5^1 = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

### Method 2: Euclidean Algorithm

1. **Use the Euclidean algorithm:**
   - This method involves repeated division.
   - Start with the numbers 20 and 30. 
   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.
   - \( 30 \div 20 = 1 \) remainder \( 10 \).
   - Now, replace the larger number (30) with the smaller number (20) and the smaller number with the remainder (10):
     - Now consider 20 and 10.
   - Divide again: \( 20 \div 10 = 2 \) remainder \( 0 \).
   - When the remainder is 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

2. **Identify the GCD:**
   - In this case, the last non-zero remainder is \( 10 \), so GCD(20, 30) = 10.

### Conclusion

In both methods, we find that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 30 is \( 10 \). This means that the largest shared factor of these two numbers is \( 10 \). You can use either method based on your preference or what seems more straightforward to you."

Next, identify the highest power of each prime factor present in the factorizations.

- For the prime number **2**:
  - In 18: \( 2^1 \)
  - In 24: \( 2^3 \)
  - The highest power is \( 2^3 \).

- For the prime number **3**:
  - In 18: \( 3^2 \)
  - In 24: \( 3^1 \)
  - The highest power is \( 3^2 \).

### Step 3: Multiply the Highest Powers
Now, multiply these highest powers together to find the LCM:

\[
LCM = 2^3 \times 3^2
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \( 2^3 = 8 \)
2. \( 3^2 = 9 \)
3. Now multiply these two results together:

\[
8 \times 9 = 72
\]

### Conclusion
The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 24 is **72**. This means that the smallest number of total flowers the gardener can use, planting them in rows without having any leftovers, is **72** flowers.

### Verification
To confirm:
- \( 72 \div 18 = 4 \) (which means you can make 4 rows of red flowers)
- \( 72 \div 24 = 3 \) (which means you can make 3 rows of blue flowers)

Since both results are whole numbers, it verifies that 72 is indeed the correct solution."

1. **Calculate \(3^4\)**:
   - \(3^4\) means you multiply \(3\) by itself four times: 
   \[
   3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3
   \]
   - First, calculate \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
   - Next, calculate \(9 \times 3 = 27\).
   - Finally, calculate \(27 \times 3 = 81\), so \(3^4 = 81\).

2. **Calculate the square root of \(64\)**:
   - The square root of \(64\) is the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives \(64\):
   \[
   \sqrt{64} = 8
   \]
   (because \(8 \times 8 = 64\)).

3. **Subtract the square root from the power calculation**:
   - Now you take the result of \(3^4\) which is \(81\) and subtract the square root of \(64\) which is \(8\):
   \[
   81 - 8 = 73
   \]

Therefore, the final result of your task is \(73\)."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","F","If the area of a square garden is 81 square feet find the length of one side of the garden.","To find the length of one side of a square garden when you know the area, you can use the formula for the area of a square. The area \( A \) of a square is given by the formula:

\[
A = s^2
\]

where \( s \) is the length of one side of the square.

In your case, the area \( A \) is 81 square feet. You can set up the equation:

\[
s^2 = 81
\]

To find \( s \), you'll need to take the square root of both sides. The square root of \( 81 \) is:

\[
s = \sqrt{81}
\]
\[
s = 9
\]

So the length of one side of the garden is 9 feet. 

In summary, the steps to solve the task are:
1. Use the area formula \( A = s^2 \).
2. Substitute the given area (81) into the formula.
3. Solve for \( s \) by taking the square root of the area.

1. **Understand the Scale:** The scale 1:250 means that 1 unit of measurement on the model is equal to 250 units of the same measurement in reality. Therefore, if we have a height of 300 meters for the actual skyscraper, we can find the height of the model by dividing the actual height by the scale factor.

2. **Convert the Actual Height to Centimeters:** Since we want the height of the model in centimeters, we need to convert the actual height from meters to centimeters. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, so:
   \[
   300 \text{ meters} = 300 \times 100 = 30,000 \text{ centimeters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Model Height:** Now, you can find the height of the model by dividing the actual height in centimeters by the scale factor:
   \[
   \text{Height of the model} = \frac{\text{Actual height in cm}}{\text{Scale factor}} = \frac{30,000 \text{ cm}}{250}
   \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   \[
   \frac{30,000}{250} = 120 \text{ cm}
   \]

Therefore, the height of the model in centimeters is **120 cm**."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","G","A recipe for a large cake requires 3 cups of flour for every 2 cups of sugar; if a baker wants to make 6 cups of flour how many cups of sugar will they need?","To solve the task of finding out how many cups of sugar the baker will need when using 6 cups of flour, we can use a ratio based on the information given in the recipe.

The recipe states that the ratio of flour to sugar is 3 cups of flour for every 2 cups of sugar. We can express this ratio as:

\[
\text{Flour:Sugar} = 3:2
\]

This means that for every 3 parts of flour, there are 2 parts of sugar. 

Now, if the baker wants to use 6 cups of flour, we need to determine how many cups of sugar corresponds to this amount based on the established ratio.

1. **Set up the proportion** based on the ratio:
   
   \[
   \frac{\text{Flour}}{\text{Sugar}} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

   Since the baker is using 6 cups of flour, we set up the proportion as follows:

   \[
   \frac{6}{\text{Sugar}} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to solve for sugar:

   \[
   6 \cdot 2 = 3 \cdot \text{Sugar}
   \]

   This simplifies to:

   \[
   12 = 3 \cdot \text{Sugar}
   \]

3. **Divide both sides by 3** to isolate sugar:

   \[
   \text{Sugar} = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]

Thus, the baker will need **4 cups of sugar** for 6 cups of flour.

In summary, by using the ratio and a simple proportion, we can determine that 6 cups of flour corresponds to 4 cups of sugar."
