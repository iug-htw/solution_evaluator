"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","A gardener needs to plant 29 flowers in rows of 3; apply the distributive property to calculate the total number of flowers he needs to plant.","To solve the task of calculating how many groups of 3 flowers are needed to reach a total of 29 flowers using the distributive property, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: The gardener wants to plant 29 flowers and arrange them in rows of 3. The problem can be framed as finding out how many complete groups of 3 can be made from 29.

2. **Set Up the Equation**: To find how many rows of 3 flowers fit into 29, you can represent the total number of flowers as an equation:
   
   \[
   29 = 3 \times n + r
   \]

   Here, \(n\) is the number of complete rows (groups of 3 flowers), and \(r\) is the remainder (the number of flowers left after forming groups of 3). 

3. **Apply the Distributive Property**: To use the distributive property effectively here, you can express 29 in terms of multiples of 3. The idea is to break down 29 into a form that makes it easier to visualize how many complete groups of 3 can be formed.

   We can rewrite 29 as:
   
   \[
   29 = 27 + 2
   \]

   Here, 27 is a multiple of 3 (specifically \(3 \times 9\)). Thus, we have:

   \[
   29 = 3 \times 9 + 2
   \]

4. **Interpret the Result**: In the expression \(3 \times 9 + 2\), you can see that the gardener can form 9 complete groups (or rows) of 3 flowers each, using up \(3 \times 9 = 27\) flowers. There will be 2 flowers remaining that cannot form a complete row of 3.

5. **Final Calculation**: Summing these up confirms that:

   \[
   3 \times 9 = 27
   \]
   and:
   \[
   27 + 2 = 29
   \]

Thus, the gardener needs to plant 29 flowers in total, and while he can plant 9 rows of 3 flowers, he will have 2 flowers left over.

In conclusion, using the distributive property helps break down the total into manageable parts, showcasing how many complete groups of flowers can be made."

Here’s a step-by-step explanation of one common method: the prime factorization method.

### Steps to calculate GCD using Prime Factorization:

1. **Find the Prime Factorization of Each Number:**
   - For **20**: 
     - Divide by 2: \( 20 ÷ 2 = 10 \)
     - Divide by 2 again: \( 10 ÷ 2 = 5 \)
     - 5 is a prime number, so we stop here.
     - The prime factorization of 20 is \( 2^2 \times 5^1 \).
   - For **30**:
     - Divide by 2: \( 30 ÷ 2 = 15 \)
     - Divide by 3: \( 15 ÷ 3 = 5 \)
     - 5 is a prime number, so we stop here.
     - The prime factorization of 30 is \( 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \).

2. **Identify the Common Prime Factors:**
   - From the prime factorizations:
     - 20: \( 2^2 \times 5^1 \)
     - 30: \( 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \)
   - The common prime factors are 2 and 5.

3. **Find the Minimum Exponent for Each Common Prime Factor:**
   - For the prime factor **2**: 
     - In 20, the exponent is 2.
     - In 30, the exponent is 1. 
     - The minimum exponent is 1.
   - For the prime factor **5**: 
     - In both 20 and 30, the exponent is 1. 
     - Thus, the minimum exponent is 1.

4. **Multiply the Common Prime Factors Raised to Their Minimum Exponent:**
   - Combine the common factors:
     - \( 2^{\text{min}(2,1)} = 2^1 \)
     - \( 5^{\text{min}(1,1)} = 5^1 \)
   - Therefore, the GCD is calculated as:
     \[
     GCD(20, 30) = 2^1 \times 5^1 = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

Thus, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 30 is **10**, which means 10 is the largest factor that both numbers share.

### Alternative Methods:
You can also calculate the GCD using:
- **Euclidean Algorithm**: It involves repeated division and finding remainders.

Here are the steps to find the LCM:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - Start by finding the prime factorization of each number.
     - For 18: 
       - 18 = 2 × 3²
     - For 24:
       - 24 = 2³ × 3¹

2. **Identify the Highest Powers**:
   - Look at each unique prime factor from the factorizations and note the highest power of each factor that appears:
     - For prime number 2: 
       - The highest power is 2³ (from 24).
     - For prime number 3:
       - The highest power is 3² (from 18).

3. **Multiply the Highest Powers Together**:
   - Now, multiply the highest powers of all prime factors:
     \[
     \text{LCM} = 2³ × 3²
     \]
     - Calculate:
     \[
     2³ = 8
     \]
     \[
     3² = 9
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM} = 8 × 9 = 72
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 24 is 72. This means the gardener can plant a total of 72 flowers in rows without having any leftovers. 

5. **Verification**:
   - To ensure that 72 is divisible by both 18 and 24:
     - \( 72 ÷ 18 = 4 \) (4 rows of 18 red flowers)
     - \( 72 ÷ 24 = 3 \) (3 rows of 24 blue flowers)
   - Since both divisions result in whole numbers, our LCM calculation is confirmed.

Thus, the answer is that the LCM of 18 and 24 is 72."

1. **Identify the ratio of flour to sugar**: The recipe states that the ratio of flour to sugar is 3 cups of flour for every 2 cups of sugar. We can express this ratio as:
   \[
   \frac{\text{flour}}{\text{sugar}} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

2. **Set up a proportion**: We need to create a proportion based on that ratio. If we let \(F\) represent the cups of flour (which is 6 cups in this case) and \(S\) represent the cups of sugar we want to find, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{F}{S} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

   Plugging in the value for \(F\):
   \[
   \frac{6}{S} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

3. **Cross-multiply to solve for \(S\)**: We can solve this proportion by cross-multiplying:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 3 \times S
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   12 = 3S
   \]

"Numbers and operations","Applying calculation strategies","E","A recipe requires \(\frac{5}{6}\) cup of sugar but Jerry only has \(\frac{1}{3}\) cup; how much more sugar does he need to gather?","To solve the task of determining how much more sugar Jerry needs, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the quantities involved**: You have two quantities:
   - The amount of sugar required for the recipe, which is \(\frac{5}{6}\) cup.
   - The amount of sugar Jerry currently has, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\) cup.

2. **Determine the difference**: To find out how much more sugar Jerry needs, subtract the amount of sugar he has from the amount needed. This can be written as:
   \[
   \text{Sugar needed} = \text{Required sugar} - \text{Current sugar}
   \]

3. **Convert the fractions to a common denominator**: To perform the subtraction correctly, both fractions need to have the same denominator. The denominators here are 6 and 3. The least common denominator (LCD) between 6 and 3 is 6.

   - Convert \(\frac{1}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 2}{3 \times 2} = \frac{2}{6}
     \]

4. **Perform the subtraction**:
   Now that both fractions have the same denominator, subtract \(\frac{2}{6}\) from \(\frac{5}{6}\):
   \[
   \frac{5}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5 - 2}{6} = \frac{3}{6}
   \]

5. **Simplify the result**: The fraction \(\frac{3}{6}\) can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:
   \[
   \frac{3}{6} = \frac{3 \div 3}{6 \div 3} = \frac{1}{2}
