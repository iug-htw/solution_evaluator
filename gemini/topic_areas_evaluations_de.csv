The explanation of ""Vielfache"" is adequate but could be improved by explicitly stating that the multiplier must be a whole number (natural number) to avoid ambiguity. The step-by-step explanation is clear but lacks depth. While the answer is correct, the focus on ""digitale Muster"" is a distraction and unnecessary at this grade level.  The explanation of the pattern is accurate but should emphasize the concept of an arithmetic sequence with a common difference explicitly. The generalization is weak; it merely asks students to repeat the process with another number.  No attempt is made to explain ""Muster"" or ""Folge"" formally.  There's no discussion of common errors (e.g., forgetting to start with 7 x 1, struggling with multiplication). The grade level appropriateness is good, although the depth could be increased."
