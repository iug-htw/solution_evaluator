Systematically count each apple ensuring you don't miss any or count any twice.  Once you have a final count write that number in the empty circle provided."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Write the numbers from 1 to 20 in order on the lines provided.","This task is straightforward.  Simply write the numbers 1 2 3 and so on sequentially up to 20 each number on a separate line.  There's no special method or trick involved; it's a basic number writing exercise."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Draw lines to connect the numbers 1 to 20 with their matching dot patterns.","This task tests your ability to count.  Each dot pattern represents a number from 1 to 20.  To solve it:

1. **Count the dots:** Carefully count the number of dots in each pattern.

2. **Find the match:** Locate the number (1-20) that corresponds to the number of dots you counted.

3. **Draw a line:** Draw a straight line connecting the number to its matching dot pattern.

Repeat steps 1-3 for each dot pattern until all numbers are connected to their correct patterns."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Circle the number that has the same number of dots underneath it; for example if you see 5 dots circle the number 5.","To solve this task you simply count the number of dots below each number. Then you circle the number that matches the count of dots directly beneath it.  For example if a number '3' has three dots underneath it you would circle the '3'.  If a number '7' has five dots underneath it you would *not* circle the '7'."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Fill in the blanks with the correct number symbol that matches the dot patterns shown on the page.","To solve this task you need to identify the pattern or rule governing the arrangement of dots in each figure.  Look for relationships between the number of dots and their spatial arrangement.  Some possibilities include:

* **Counting Dots:** The simplest approach is to simply count the dots in each figure. If the number of dots increases sequentially the blank should be filled with the symbol representing the next number in the sequence.

* **Geometric Patterns:** Observe if the dots form geometric shapes (squares triangles etc.).  The progression might be based on adding a row column or changing the shape systematically.  Analyze how the shapes evolve from one figure to the next.

* **Combinations:** The pattern might involve a combination of counting and geometric patterns.  For instance the number of dots might increase while simultaneously changing the shape they form.

* **Symmetry/Rotation:** Check if there's any symmetry or rotational pattern.  The progression might involve rotating the dot arrangement or adding dots symmetrically.


**Steps to solve:**

1. **Analyze Each Figure:** Carefully examine each figure with dots. Count the dots and observe their arrangement. Note any changes or consistent elements from one figure to another.

2. **Identify the Pattern:** Determine the underlying pattern or rule connecting the figures. This could involve addition subtraction multiplication division or geometric transformations.

3. **Predict the Next Figure:** Based on the identified pattern predict the number of dots and their arrangement in the missing figure.

4. **Select the Matching Symbol:** Choose the symbol containing the predicted number of dots arranged according to the pattern.


Without seeing the specific dot patterns this is the general strategy. Providing the images of the dot patterns would allow for a more specific solution."

"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","A bakery sells packs of cookies for $24 each and a customer wants to buy 4 packs; use the distributive property to find the total cost.","The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac.  We can use this to solve the cookie problem efficiently.

Instead of directly multiplying 4 packs * $24/pack we can break down the $24 into smaller easier-to-work-with numbers.

**Method 1: Breaking down $24**

Let's break down $24 into $20 + $4:

* 4 packs * ($20 + $4/pack)  = (4 packs * $20/pack) + (4 packs * $4/pack)
* = $80 + $16
* = $96

**Method 2: Breaking down the number of packs**

Alternatively you can break down the number of packs:

Let's consider two packs as a single unit:

* (2 packs * 2 units) * $24/pack
* = 2 units * (2 packs * $24/pack)
* = 2 units * $48/unit
* = $96


Both methods use the distributive property to simplify the multiplication making it easier to calculate the total cost mentally or with simpler arithmetic.  The key is to break down either the cost per pack or the number of packs into easier-to-manage components."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","If a box contains 36 chocolates and is divided equally into 4 smaller boxes how many chocolates will be in each box using the distributive property?","The distributive property in this context isn't strictly necessary to solve this problem but we can illustrate its application.  The problem is essentially asking us to divide 36 by 4.

**Direct Division:**  The simplest way is to directly divide: 36 chocolates / 4 boxes = 9 chocolates per box.

**Distributive Property Approach:**

We can think of 36 as a sum of numbers easily divisible by 4.  For example:

36 = 20 + 16

Now using the distributive property (a(b + c) = ab + ac) we can say:

36 / 4 = (20 + 16) / 4 = (20/4) + (16/4) = 5 + 4 = 9

So there will be 9 chocolates in each box.  This illustrates the distributive property by breaking the division into smaller easier divisions. You could also use other combinations like 36 = 12 + 12 + 12  then divide each of the 12's by 4 and add the results. The important point is that you are distributing the division across the addition.  It’s a less efficient method than direct division in this case but it demonstrates the concept."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","A gardener needs to plant 29 flowers in rows of 3; apply the distributive property to calculate the total number of flowers he needs to plant.","The problem asks us to find the total number of flowers which is 29 but it wants us to use the distributive property to illustrate the calculation even though it seems unnecessary for a simple multiplication.  We can artificially break down the number 29 to apply the distributive property.

Here's how:

1. **Break down 29:**  We can express 29 as a sum of two numbers easily divisible by 3.  A convenient choice is 27 + 2 (because 27 is divisible by 3).

2. **Apply the distributive property:**  The total number of flowers can be represented as 3 * (number of rows).  We rewrite this using our breakdown of 29:

   3 * (number of rows) = 3 * [(27/3) + (2/3)]  We're aiming to represent the number of rows which when multiplied by 3 gives 29. It is not about calculating the number of rows explicitly because there will be incomplete rows.

3. **Distribute:** Now we apply the distributive property:

   3 * [(27/3) + (2/3)] = (3 * 27/3) + (3 * 2/3) = 27 + 2 = 29

Therefore although 29 flowers in rows of 3 doesn't naturally lend itself to the distributive property in a practical planting scenario we've mathematically demonstrated it by breaking down 29 into convenient parts divisible by 3.  The final answer 29 is of course obtained directly by multiplying 9 rows of 3 with a leftover 2 to make the 29."

1. **Decimal:** Divide 3 by 8:  3 ÷ 8 = 0.375

2. **Percentage:** To convert a decimal to a percentage multiply the decimal by 100 and add a percent sign (%).

   0.375 x 100 = 37.5%

Therefore 3/8 is equal to 0.375 as a decimal and 37.5% as a percentage."

1. **Write the percentage as a fraction with a denominator of 100:**  85% becomes 85/100.

2. **Simplify the fraction:** Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator (85) and the denominator (100).  The GCD of 85 and 100 is 5.

3. **Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:**  85 ÷ 5 = 17 and 100 ÷ 5 = 20.

Therefore the simplest form of the fraction is 17/20."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","G","If a shirt costs $45 and is on sale for 30% off determine the sale price in decimal form.","To find the sale price follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount:** Multiply the original price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal).  30% as a decimal is 0.30.  So $45 * 0.30 = $13.50

2. **Subtract the discount from the original price:** Subtract the discount amount you calculated from the original price of the shirt. $45 - $13.50 = $31.50

Therefore the sale price of the shirt is $31.50."

"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","F","A mountain climber ascends 200 meters then descends 50 meters; what is her final elevation change from sea level?","To find the climber's final elevation change you need to consider the ascent and descent as separate changes in elevation.

1. **Ascent:** The climber goes up 200 meters.

2. **Descent:** The climber then goes down 50 meters.

3. **Net Change:** To find the overall change subtract the descent from the ascent: 200 meters - 50 meters = 150 meters.

Therefore the climber's final elevation change from sea level is a net increase of 150 meters.  If we assume she started at sea level (0 meters) her final elevation would be 150 meters above sea level."

"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","List all the factors of 36 and identify which of these factors are also prime numbers.","To solve this task follow these steps:

1. **Find all factors of 36:**  A factor is a number that divides evenly into 36 without leaving a remainder.  We can find them systematically:

   * Start with 1 (every number is divisible by 1):  1 x 36 = 36
   * Try 2: 2 x 18 = 36
   * Try 3: 3 x 12 = 36
   * Try 4: 4 x 9 = 36
   * Try 5: 5 doesn't divide evenly into 36
   * Try 6: 6 x 6 = 36
   * Notice that after 6 we start repeating factors (we've already found 9 12 18 and 36).  This is because factors come in pairs.


   Therefore the factors of 36 are 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36.

2. **Identify the prime factors:** A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.  From the list of factors above let's check each:

   * 1 is not a prime number (by definition).
   * 2 is a prime number (only divisible by 1 and 2).
   * 3 is a prime number (only divisible by 1 and 3).
   * 4 is not a prime number (divisible by 1 2 and 4).
   * 6 is not a prime number (divisible by 1 2 3 and 6).
   * 9 is not a prime number (divisible by 1 3 and 9).
   * 12 is not a prime number.
   * 18 is not a prime number.
   * 36 is not a prime number.

Therefore the prime factors of 36 are 2 and 3."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","Calculate the first five multiples of 7 and explain the pattern you observe in those multiples.","To calculate the first five multiples of 7 you simply multiply 7 by each of the first five whole numbers (0 1 2 3 and 4).

"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","If you have 48 apples and want to divide them equally into baskets determine all the possible numbers of baskets you can use by finding the factors of 48.","To find all the possible numbers of baskets you can use you need to find all the factors of 48.  Factors are numbers that divide evenly into 48 without leaving a remainder.  You can do this in a few ways:

**Method 1:  Listing Factor Pairs**

Start by listing pairs of numbers that multiply to 48:

* 1 x 48
* 2 x 24
* 3 x 16
* 4 x 12
* 6 x 8

Each number in these pairs is a factor of 48. Therefore you could use 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 16 24 or 48 baskets.

**Method 2:  Prime Factorization**

1. Find the prime factorization of 48.  This means expressing 48 as a product of prime numbers (numbers only divisible by 1 and themselves).  48 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3  (or 2⁴ x 3)

2.  Use the prime factorization to build all possible combinations of factors.  Since you have four 2s and one 3 you can create factors by combining these:

   * Using only 2s: 2 4 8 16
   * Using 3: 3 6 12 24 48 (combining 3 with the factors from step 2 above)

This method ensures you don't miss any factors.  Again this gives you the same set of possible basket numbers: 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 16 24 48."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 12 to determine how often their multiples will coincide.","To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 12 you can use a few methods:

**Method 1: Listing Multiples**

1. **List the multiples of each number:**
   * Multiples of 8: 8 16 24 32 40 48 ...
   * Multiples of 12: 12 24 36 48 60 ...

2. **Identify the smallest common multiple:** The smallest number that appears in both lists is 24.  Therefore the LCM of 8 and 12 is 24.

**Method 2: Prime Factorization**

1. **Find the prime factorization of each number:**
   * 8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2³
   * 12 = 2 x 2 x 3 = 2² x 3

2. **Identify the highest power of each prime factor:** The prime factors are 2 and 3.  The highest power of 2 is 2³ (from the factorization of 8) and the highest power of 3 is 3¹ (from the factorization of 12).

3. **Multiply the highest powers together:** 2³ x 3 = 8 x 3 = 24.  The LCM is 24.

**Method 3: Using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**

1. **Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 12:**  You can use the Euclidean algorithm or prime factorization for this.  The GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.

2. **Use the formula: LCM(a b) = (a x b) / GCD(a b):**  LCM(8 12) = (8 x 12) / 4 = 96 / 4 = 24.

In all cases the LCM is 24. This means the multiples of 8 and 12 will coincide every 24 units.  For example 24 is a multiple of both 8 (8 x 3 = 24) and 12 (12 x 2 = 24).  The next common multiple would be 48 (24 x 2) then 72 (24 x 3) and so on."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 30 to understand their largest shared factor.","There are several ways to calculate the GCD of 20 and 30. Here are two common methods:

**1. Listing Factors:**

* **Find the factors of each number:**
    * Factors of 20: 1 2 4 5 10 20
    * Factors of 30: 1 2 3 5 6 10 15 30

* **Identify the common factors:**  Both lists share 1 2 5 and 10.

* **Find the greatest common factor:** The largest number in the list of common factors is 10.  Therefore the GCD of 20 and 30 is 10.


**2. Euclidean Algorithm:**

This method is more efficient for larger numbers.  It's based on repeated division with remainder.

1. **Divide the larger number (30) by the smaller number (20):** 30 ÷ 20 = 1 with a remainder of 10.

2. **Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder:** Now we find the GCD of 20 and 10.

3. **Repeat the division:** 20 ÷ 10 = 2 with a remainder of 0.

4. **The GCD is the last non-zero remainder:** Since the remainder is 0 the GCD is the previous remainder which is 10.

Therefore using either method the greatest common divisor of 20 and 30 is 10.  This means 10 is the largest number that divides both 20 and 30 without leaving a remainder."

This means the number of rows must be a divisor of both 18 and 24.  To find the largest possible number of rows (and thus the smallest number of total flowers per row) we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 24.

However the question asks for the least common multiple (LCM) to find the *smallest* number of *total* flowers.  While the GCD helps determine the maximum number of *rows* the LCM helps determine the smallest number of *flowers*.

Here's how to solve it using the LCM:

1. **Find the prime factorization of each number:**

   * 18 = 2 x 3 x 3 = 2 x 3²
   * 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 2³ x 3

2. **Identify the highest power of each prime factor present in either factorization:**

   * The highest power of 2 is 2³ = 8
   * The highest power of 3 is 3² = 9

3. **Multiply the highest powers together to find the LCM:**

   * LCM(18 24) = 2³ x 3² = 8 x 9 = 72

Therefore the smallest number of total flowers the gardener can use without having leftovers is 72.  This means he'll have 4 rows of 18 red flowers (72 total) and 3 rows of 24 blue flowers (72 total).  The 72 flowers are arranged in rows of (18 red + 24 blue) = 4 rows or (6 red + 8 blue) = 3 rows of this combination."

1. **Calculate 3 raised to the power of 4 (3⁴):**  This means multiplying 3 by itself four times: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81

2. **Calculate the square root of 64 (√64):** This is the number that when multiplied by itself equals 64.  That number is 8.

3. **Subtract the square root of 64 from the result of 3⁴:** Subtract the result from step 2 (8) from the result of step 1 (81): 81 - 8 = 73

Therefore the final answer is $\boxed{73}$."

Since we know the area is 81 square feet we need to find the number that when multiplied by itself equals 81.  This is the square root of 81.

Therefore to solve this:

1. **Find the square root of 81.**  You can do this using a calculator or by remembering your multiplication tables (9 x 9 = 81).

2. **The result is the length of one side of the garden.**  In this case the length of one side is 9 feet."

1. **Find the square root of 49:**  The square root of a number is a value that when multiplied by itself gives the original number.  The square root of 49 is 7 (because 7 * 7 = 49).

2. **Raise 2 to the power of 5:** This means multiplying 2 by itself five times: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32.

3. **Find the sum:** Add the results from steps 1 and 2: 7 + 32 = 39

Therefore the solution is $\boxed{39}$."

The scale 1:250 means that 1 unit of measurement on the model represents 250 units of the same measurement on the actual skyscraper.

1. **Convert units:** The skyscraper's height is given in meters but we want the model's height in centimeters.  There are 100 centimeters in a meter so the actual skyscraper height is 300 meters * 100 cm/meter = 30000 centimeters.

2. **Apply the scale:** Now use the scale to find the model's height.  Since 1 cm on the model represents 250 cm in reality divide the actual height by the scale factor: 30000 cm / 250 = 120 cm.

Therefore the height of the model is 120 centimeters."

The recipe establishes a ratio of flour to sugar: 3 cups flour : 2 cups sugar.

To find out how much sugar is needed for 6 cups of flour we need to maintain this ratio.  We can do this using proportions:

**Method 1:  Scaling the Ratio**

Notice that to go from 3 cups of flour to 6 cups of flour we multiply by 2 (3 cups * 2 = 6 cups).  To maintain the ratio we must also multiply the amount of sugar by 2: 2 cups * 2 = 4 cups of sugar.

**Method 2: Setting up a Proportion**

We can set up a proportion:

(flour_1 / sugar_1) = (flour_2 / sugar_2)

Where:

* flour_1 = 3 cups
* sugar_1 = 2 cups
* flour_2 = 6 cups
* sugar_2 = x (what we want to find)

So the proportion becomes:

3/2 = 6/x

To solve for x we can cross-multiply:

3 * x = 2 * 6

3x = 12

x = 12 / 3

x = 4

Therefore the baker will need 4 cups of sugar."

The map scale gives you a ratio: 1 inch on the map corresponds to 30 miles in reality.

Set up a proportion:

(inches on map) / (miles in reality) = (inches on map) / (miles in reality)

Substitute the known values:

1 inch / 30 miles = 5 inches / x miles

Now solve for 'x' (the actual distance between the towns):

Cross-multiply:  1 * x = 5 * 30

Simplify: x = 150

Therefore the actual distance between the two towns is 150 miles."

1. **Round 237 to the nearest ten:**  The tens digit is 3. The units digit (7) is 5 or greater so we round up.  237 rounds to 240.

2. **Round 185 to the nearest ten:** The tens digit is 8. The units digit (5) is 5 or greater so we round up. 185 rounds to 190.

3. **Add the rounded numbers:** 240 + 190 = 430

Therefore the bookstore sold approximately 430 books in total."
"Numbers and operations","Applying calculation strategies","D","A farmer has 489 apples and plans to give away 275 apples; estimate how many apples he will have left by rounding to the nearest ten.","Here's how to solve this problem using rounding to the nearest ten:

1. **Round the initial number of apples:** The farmer has 489 apples.  Rounding to the nearest ten means looking at the ones digit (9). Since it's 5 or greater we round the tens digit up.  489 rounds up to 490.

2. **Round the number of apples given away:** The farmer gives away 275 apples. The ones digit is 5 so we round the tens digit up. 275 rounds up to 280.

3. **Subtract the rounded numbers:** Subtract the rounded number of apples given away from the rounded number of apples the farmer started with: 490 - 280 = 210

Therefore the farmer will have approximately 210 apples left."

1. **Round to the nearest ten:** Round both the amount raised and the amount spent to the nearest ten.

   * $1248 rounds to $1250 (because the ones digit 8 is 5 or greater so we round up).
   * $673 rounds to $670 (because the ones digit 3 is less than 5 so we round down).

2. **Subtract:** Subtract the rounded amount spent from the rounded amount raised: $1250 - $670 = $580

3. **State the answer:** The estimated amount left is $580.  This is an approximation; the exact amount may be slightly different."
"Numbers and operations","Applying calculation strategies","E","Jenna has \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza and her friend gives her \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a pizza; how much pizza does Jenna have now?","To solve this you need to add the two fractions together.  However you can't directly add fractions with different denominators (the bottom numbers).  First find a common denominator – a number that both 3 and 4 divide into evenly.  The least common denominator for 3 and 4 is 12.

Next convert each fraction to have a denominator of 12:

* \(\frac{2}{3}\) becomes \(\frac{8}{12}\) (multiply both the numerator and denominator by 4)
* \(\frac{1}{4}\) becomes \(\frac{3}{12}\) (multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3)

Now you can add the fractions:

\(\frac{8}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{11}{12}\)

Jenna now has \(\frac{11}{12}\) of a pizza."

1. **Find a common denominator:**  The fractions have denominators of 6 and 3. The least common denominator is 6.

2. **Convert the fractions:**  The fraction 1/3 can be converted to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 2: (1/3) * (2/2) = 2/6

3. **Subtract the fractions:** Subtract the amount Jerry has (2/6 cup) from the amount the recipe requires (5/6 cup):  5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6

4. **Simplify the fraction (if possible):** The fraction 3/6 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor which is 3:  3/6 = 1/2

Therefore Jerry needs an additional **1/2** cup of sugar."
