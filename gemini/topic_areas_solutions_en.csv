2. **Draw the Stars:** Draw 10 five-pointed stars inside the box. You can space them out evenly or arrange them randomly however you like.  They don't need to be perfect; a simple star shape is sufficient.

3. **Color the Stars:** Choose 5 of the 10 stars you've drawn.  Color these 5 stars blue using crayons colored pencils markers or paint.  The remaining 5 stars can be left uncolored or colored in a different color if you wish.

That's it! You've successfully completed the task."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Count the number of apples in the picture and write the total number in the empty circle below.","To solve this task you need to visually inspect the picture and count each individual apple.  There's no mathematical formula; it's a straightforward counting exercise.  Once you've counted all the apples write the final number inside the empty circle provided."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Write the numbers from 1 to 20 in order on the lines provided.","This task is very straightforward.  Simply write the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 each on a separate line."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Draw lines to connect the numbers 1 to 20 with their matching dot patterns.","This task is a simple matching exercise.  You'll need a sheet of paper (or screen) showing the numbers 1 through 20 and another sheet (or section) showing dot patterns representing those same numbers.  

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Understand the pattern:**  Each number will correspond to a dot pattern showing that many dots.  For example the number '1' will have one dot '2' will have two dots and so on.  The dot patterns might be arranged in different formations (e.g. a straight line a square a more random arrangement) but the crucial element is the *number* of dots.

2. **Start with the easy ones:** Begin by matching the smaller numbers (1 2 3 etc.) as they are easier to count and visually verify.

3. **Systematic approach:** Proceed sequentially through the numbers from 1 to 20. For each number locate the corresponding dot pattern with the same quantity of dots.

4. **Double-check:** Once you've made all the connections take a moment to review your work.  Make sure each number is accurately paired with its dot pattern count.


In short it's a counting and visual matching activity.  Accuracy is key.  If you have any difficulty counting dots in a complex pattern try to organize the dots mentally or physically to make counting simpler."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Circle the number that has the same number of dots underneath it; for example if you see 5 dots circle the number 5.","This is a simple counting task.  Follow these steps:

1. **Count the dots:** Look at the dots below each number. Count how many dots are present for each number.

2. **Match the count to the number:**  Find the number that matches the count of dots you just made.

3. **Circle the number:** Circle the number that has the same quantity as the number of dots below it.


For example:

If you see the number ""3"" with three dots underneath it circle the ""3"".  If you see the number ""7"" with five dots underneath it you would *not* circle it. You'd continue searching until you found a number with five dots beneath it and then circle that number."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Fill in the blanks with the correct number symbol that matches the dot patterns shown on the page.","To solve this task you need to identify the underlying pattern or rule connecting the dot patterns to the number symbols.  There are several possibilities depending on the specific dot patterns provided.  Here's a breakdown of how to approach it:

**1. Analyze the Dot Patterns:**

* **Counting:** The simplest approach is to simply count the dots in each pattern.  If the number of dots directly corresponds to a number symbol that's your answer.
* **Grouping:**  Look for ways the dots might be grouped.  Are they arranged in rows columns or other shapes?  The arrangement might be key to understanding the number symbol.
* **Spatial Arrangement:** Consider the spatial relationships between the dots.  Are they equally spaced?  Do they form a specific geometric shape? This information could hold the clue.
* **Combinations:**  Sometimes the pattern uses a combination of counting and grouping or spatial arrangement.  For instance the number of groups of dots might be important or the number of dots in a specific group might be relevant.

**2. Analyze the Number Symbols:**

* **Numerals:** Are the number symbols standard numerals (1 2 3 etc.)?  If so the dot patterns likely directly represent these numbers.
* **Other Symbols:** If the symbols are not standard numerals they might be representing something else entirely.  You may need to decipher their meaning based on the provided examples.  This might involve looking for patterns among the symbols themselves.


**3. Establish the Relationship:**

Once you have analyzed both the dot patterns and the number symbols try to establish a clear relationship between them.  This often involves finding a consistent rule that works for *all* the provided examples.  For example:

* **One-to-one correspondence:** Each dot corresponds to a unit of the number.
* **Grouping:**  Each group of dots represents a specific numerical value.
* **Positional value:** The position of the dots in a pattern might signify a positional value within a number system (like ones tens hundreds).


**4. Test the Rule:**

Once you've determined a potential rule test it on all the given examples to ensure it consistently works.  If the rule doesn't work for all examples you need to reconsider your approach and look for a different pattern.

**Example:**

Let's say you have these examples:

* **Pattern A:**  Three dots arranged in a row (***)  --->  Symbol: 3
* **Pattern B:**  Six dots arranged in two rows of three (*** ***) ---> Symbol: 6
* **Pattern C:**  Nine dots arranged in three rows of three (*** *** ***) ---> Symbol: 9


The rule here is clearly a one-to-one correspondence: the number of dots equals the number symbol.


**In short:**  Carefully examine the dot patterns for any type of pattern (counting grouping spatial relationships) and compare them to the provided number symbols to find the consistent rule linking them together.  Always test your discovered rule on all provided examples before filling in the blanks."

"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","A bakery sells packs of cookies for $24 each and a customer wants to buy 4 packs; use the distributive property to find the total cost.","The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac.  We can use this to solve the cookie problem in a slightly roundabout but illustrative way to demonstrate the property.

Instead of directly multiplying 4 packs * $24/pack we can break down the $24 into smaller easier-to-work-with numbers.  Let's say we break it down into $20 + $4:

1. **Rewrite the problem:** The total cost is 4 * ($20 + $4).

2. **Apply the distributive property:** This becomes (4 * $20) + (4 * $4).

3. **Solve each part:**
   * 4 * $20 = $80
   * 4 * $4 = $16

4. **Add the results:** $80 + $16 = $96

Therefore the total cost of 4 packs of cookies is $96.  While this is a longer method than simply multiplying 4 x 24 it effectively shows how the distributive property works."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","If a box contains 36 chocolates and is divided equally into 4 smaller boxes how many chocolates will be in each box using the distributive property?","The distributive property isn't strictly necessary to solve this problem but we can illustrate it.  The problem is essentially 36 ÷ 4.

**Direct Division:** The simplest way is just to divide 36 by 4:  36 ÷ 4 = 9 chocolates per box.

**Distributive Property Approach:**

Think of the 36 chocolates as groups.  We can break down the 36 into smaller easier-to-divide groups.  Let's use the distributive property to show this:

1. **Break down 36:** We can express 36 as 20 + 16 (or any other combination that's easily divisible by 4).

2. **Distribute the division:**  We can then divide each part separately:

   (20 ÷ 4) + (16 ÷ 4) = 5 + 4 = 9

Therefore each smaller box will have 9 chocolates.  This demonstrates the distributive property of division over addition.  We've distributed the division across the sum (20 + 16) and got the same result.  While this is more complex than direct division for this specific problem it illustrates how the distributive property *can* be applied."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","A gardener needs to plant 29 flowers in rows of 3; apply the distributive property to calculate the total number of flowers he needs to plant.","You can't directly use the distributive property in the *traditional* sense (a(b+c) = ab + ac) to solve this problem because the problem doesn't naturally break down into a sum of easily-divisible groups.  The distributive property is most helpful when you're dealing with multiplication involving sums or differences.

Instead the problem is asking you to think about the number 29 in terms of multiples of 3.  You could solve it in a couple of ways leveraging related mathematical concepts:

**Method 1:  Using division and multiplication (with a bit of implied distributive)**

1. **Divide:** Divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per row: 29 ÷ 3 = 9 with a remainder of 2.

2. **Interpret the Result:** This means the gardener can make 9 full rows of 3 flowers each.  The remainder of 2 represents flowers left over that won't make a full row.

3. **Calculate Total:**  The total number of flowers is (9 rows * 3 flowers/row) + 2 leftover flowers = 27 + 2 = 29 flowers.  While not explicitly distributive in the a(b+c) form the calculation of the total number from the full rows and the remainder implicitly uses a distributive-like idea.

**Method 2:  Expressing 29 as a sum involving a multiple of 3**

1. **Find a Multiple:** Find the closest multiple of 3 that's less than 29. That's 27 (3 x 9).

2. **Rewrite 29:** Rewrite 29 as a sum involving that multiple of 3: 29 = 27 + 2

3. **Calculate:**  This implicitly uses a distributive property-like approach. You could view it as 3 * (9) + 2.  This shows the 9 rows of 3 plus the remaining 2.  The total is still 29.


In short while the problem statement mentions the distributive property a direct application isn't the most efficient or natural way to solve it. The problem tests your understanding of division with remainders and how to break down a number into parts useful for solving the problem."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","G","Convert the fraction 3/8 into a decimal and a percentage.","To convert the fraction 3/8 into a decimal and a percentage follow these steps:

**1. Decimal:**

* **Divide the numerator by the denominator:**  Divide 3 by 8.  This can be done using long division or a calculator.
* **Result:** 3 ÷ 8 = 0.375

Therefore the decimal representation of 3/8 is 0.375.


**2. Percentage:**

* **Convert the decimal to a percentage:** Multiply the decimal by 100.
* **Add the % symbol:**  0.375 x 100 = 37.5%

"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","List all the factors of 36 and identify which of these factors are also prime numbers.","To solve this task follow these steps:

**1. Find all factors of 36:**

A factor of a number is a whole number that divides evenly into that number without leaving a remainder.  To find all the factors of 36 systematically consider all the whole numbers from 1 up to 36 checking if they divide 36 without a remainder.

You can do this by:

* **Starting with 1:** 1 is always a factor.
* **Trying successive numbers:** 2 divides 36 (36/2 = 18) so 2 and 18 are factors.  Continue with 3 (36/3 = 12) 4 (36/4 = 9) 6 (36/6 = 6) etc.
* **Pairing:** Notice that once you reach the square root of 36 (which is 6) you'll start repeating factor pairs (because 6 x 6 = 36 and you've already found 6).


Therefore the factors of 36 are: 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36.

**2. Identify the prime factors:**

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.  Now look at the list of factors you generated in step 1 and identify which ones are prime:

* **1 is not prime:** By definition prime numbers must be greater than 1.
* **2 is prime:** Its only divisors are 1 and 2.
* **3 is prime:** Its only divisors are 1 and 3.
* **4 is not prime:** It's divisible by 1 2 and 4.
* **6 is not prime:** It's divisible by 1 2 3 and 6.
* **9 is not prime:** It's divisible by 1 3 and 9.
* **12 is not prime:**  It's divisible by 1 2 3 4 6 and 12.
* **18 is not prime:** It's divisible by 1 2 3 6 9 and 18.
* **36 is not prime:** It's divisible by many numbers.

**Conclusion:**

The factors of 36 are 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36.  The prime factors of 36 are 2 and 3."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","Calculate the first five multiples of 7 and explain the pattern you observe in those multiples.","To solve this task follow these steps:

1. **Find the first five multiples of 7:**  A multiple of a number is the result of multiplying that number by an integer (whole number).  So we'll multiply 7 by the first five integers (1 2 3 4 and 5):

   * 7 x 1 = 7
   * 7 x 2 = 14
   * 7 x 3 = 21
   * 7 x 4 = 28
   * 7 x 5 = 35

2. **Observe the pattern:** Now look at the sequence of numbers you've generated: 7 14 21 28 35.  Notice the pattern:

   * **Arithmetic sequence:** The difference between consecutive numbers is always the same (7).  Each number is 7 more than the previous number. This is called an arithmetic sequence.
   * **Units digit pattern:** The units digits (the last digit of each number) follow a pattern: 7 4 1 8 5.  This pattern will repeat for subsequent multiples.
   * **Tens digit pattern (less consistent):**  The tens digits change less predictably in this short sequence but would reveal a more consistent pattern with more multiples.


Therefore your answer should include the five multiples (7 14 21 28 35) and a description of the observed patterns specifically the constant difference of 7 between consecutive multiples and the repeating pattern of the units digits."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","If you have 48 apples and want to divide them equally into baskets determine all the possible numbers of baskets you can use by finding the factors of 48.","To find all the possible numbers of baskets you can use you need to find all the factors of 48.  Factors are numbers that divide evenly into 48 without leaving a remainder.  Here's how to do it:

**Method 1:  Listing Factors Systematically**

1. **Start with 1:** 1 is always a factor of any number.  (1 basket containing 48 apples)

2. **Check for 2:** 48 is an even number so it's divisible by 2. (2 baskets with 24 apples each)

3. **Check for 3:** Add the digits of 48 (4+8=12). Since 12 is divisible by 3 48 is also divisible by 3. (3 baskets with 16 apples each)

4. **Continue with other numbers:**  Try 4 5 6 and so on.  If a number divides evenly into 48 it's a factor.  If it doesn't divide evenly move on.

5. **Stop when you reach the square root:** Once you find a factor that is larger than the square root of 48 (approximately 6.9) you've found all the factors.  Any larger factor will have a corresponding smaller factor you've already found.

6. **List your factors:**  You'll find the factors of 48 are: 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 16 24 and 48.


**Method 2: Prime Factorization**

1. **Find the prime factorization:** Express 48 as a product of prime numbers.  48 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 2⁴ x 3

2. **Generate factors:** To find all the factors consider all possible combinations of these prime factors:

   * Using only 2s: 2¹ 2² 2³ 2⁴  (2 4 8 16)
   * Using 3: 3¹ (3)
   * Combinations of 2s and 3s: 2¹ x 3¹ = 6; 2² x 3¹ = 12; 2³ x 3¹ = 24; 2⁴ x 3¹ = 48; and 1 (the combination of no prime factors)

This method ensures you find all factors without missing any.  You'll arrive at the same list as Method 1: 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 16 24 and 48.

Therefore you can use 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 16 24 or 48 baskets."

   * Multiples of 8: 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72...
   * Multiples of 12: 12 24 36 48 60 72...

2. **Identify the smallest common multiple:**  The smallest number that appears in both lists is 24.  Therefore the LCM(8 12) = 24.

**Method 2: Prime Factorization**

1. **Find the prime factorization of each number:**
   * 8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2³
   * 12 = 2 x 2 x 3 = 2² x 3

2. **Identify the highest power of each prime factor:** The prime factors are 2 and 3. The highest power of 2 is 2³ (from the factorization of 8) and the highest power of 3 is 3¹ (from the factorization of 12).

3. **Multiply the highest powers together:** LCM(8 12) = 2³ x 3 = 8 x 3 = 24

**Method 3: Using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**

1. **Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 12:** You can use the Euclidean algorithm or prime factorization for this.  Using prime factorization:
   * 8 = 2³
   * 12 = 2² x 3
   * The common factors are 2² so GCD(8 12) = 4

2. **Use the formula: LCM(a b) = (a x b) / GCD(a b)**
   * LCM(8 12) = (8 x 12) / 4 = 96 / 4 = 24

**How often their multiples coincide:**

The LCM of 8 and 12 is 24.  This means that the multiples of 8 and 12 will coincide every 24 units.  In other words every 24th multiple of 8 will also be a multiple of 12 and vice versa.  For example:

* Multiples of 8: 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 72...
* Multiples of 12: 12 24 36 48 60 72...

The common multiples are 24 48 72...  They coincide every 24 units."

**1. Listing Factors:**

* **Find the factors of 20:** 1 2 4 5 10 20
* **Find the factors of 30:** 1 2 3 5 6 10 15 30
* **Identify the common factors:** 1 2 5 10
* **The greatest common factor (which is the GCD) is 10.**

This method is straightforward for smaller numbers but becomes cumbersome with larger numbers.

**2. Prime Factorization:**

* **Find the prime factorization of 20:** 2² x 5
* **Find the prime factorization of 30:** 2 x 3 x 5
* **Identify the common prime factors:** 2 and 5
* **Multiply the common prime factors to the lowest power they appear in either factorization:** 2¹ x 5¹ = 10
* **The GCD is 10.**

This method is more efficient for larger numbers than listing all factors.

**3. Euclidean Algorithm:**

This is the most efficient method for larger numbers.  It involves repeatedly applying the division algorithm until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

1. Divide the larger number (30) by the smaller number (20): 30 ÷ 20 = 1 with a remainder of 10.
2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (20) and the smaller number with the remainder (10):  20 ÷ 10 = 2 with a remainder of 0.
3. Since the remainder is 0 the GCD is the last non-zero remainder which is 10.

Therefore the greatest common divisor of 20 and 30 is $\boxed{10}$."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","A gardener wants to plant flowers in rows using 18 red flowers and 24 blue flowers; what is the LCM of 18 and 24 to find the smallest number of total flowers he can use without having leftovers?","The gardener wants to arrange both red and blue flowers in equal-sized rows without any flowers left over.  This means the number of rows must be a common divisor of both 18 and 24.  To find the *largest* possible number of rows (and thus the *smallest* number of total flowers) we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 24.

However the problem states we need to use the *least common multiple* (LCM). The LCM is used to find the smallest number of *total flowers* needed. Here's why the LCM is relevant:

* **Rows of Red Flowers:**  The gardener can arrange 18 red flowers in rows of 1 2 3 6 9 or 18 flowers per row.
* **Rows of Blue Flowers:** The gardener can arrange 24 blue flowers in rows of 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 or 24 flowers per row.

To have the same number of flowers in each row for both colors the number of flowers per row must be a common divisor of both 18 and 24. The *largest* such common divisor is the GCD(18 24) = 6.

If he uses 6 flowers per row:

* He'll have 18 red flowers / 6 flowers/row = 3 rows of red flowers.
* He'll have 24 blue flowers / 6 flowers/row = 4 rows of blue flowers.

This isn't what we want; he needs the *same* number of rows for both colors.  This is where the LCM comes in.

The LCM(18 24) gives us the smallest number of *flowers per color* that allows for a whole number of rows of equal size for both colors.  We find the LCM as follows:

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   * 18 = 2 x 3 x 3 = 2 x 3²
   * 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 2³ x 3

2. **LCM Calculation:** To find the LCM take the highest power of each prime factor present in either number:
   * LCM(18 24) = 2³ x 3² = 8 x 9 = 72

Therefore the smallest number of *total* flowers he can use without leftovers is 72.  He'll have 4 rows of 18 red flowers (72 total red flowers) and 3 rows of 24 blue flowers (72 total blue flowers) resulting in 72 flowers total.  Each row will contain 18 red and 24 blue flowers.  The total number of flowers per row will be 42."

1. **Understand the scale:** The scale 1:250 means that 1 unit of measurement on the model represents 250 units of the same measurement on the actual skyscraper.

2. **Convert units:**  The skyscraper's height is given in meters but we want the model's height in centimeters.  There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. Therefore the actual height of the skyscraper is 300 meters * 100 cm/meter = 30000 centimeters.

3. **Apply the scale:**  Divide the actual height in centimeters by the scale factor: 30000 cm / 250 = 120 cm

**Therefore the height of the model is 120 centimeters.**"
