2. **Draw the Stars:** Draw 10 five-pointed stars inside the box. You can space them out evenly or arrange them randomly however you like.  They don't need to be perfect; a simple star shape is sufficient.

3. **Color the Stars:** Choose 5 of the 10 stars you've drawn.  Color these 5 stars blue using crayons colored pencils markers or paint.  The remaining 5 stars can be left uncolored or colored in a different color if you wish.

That's it! You've successfully completed the task."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Count the number of apples in the picture and write the total number in the empty circle below.","To solve this task you need to visually inspect the picture and count each individual apple.  There's no mathematical formula; it's a straightforward counting exercise.  Once you've counted all the apples write the final number inside the empty circle provided."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Write the numbers from 1 to 20 in order on the lines provided.","This task is very straightforward.  Simply write the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 each on a separate line."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Draw lines to connect the numbers 1 to 20 with their matching dot patterns.","This task is a simple matching exercise.  You'll need a sheet of paper (or screen) showing the numbers 1 through 20 and another sheet (or section) showing dot patterns representing those same numbers.  

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Understand the pattern:**  Each number will correspond to a dot pattern showing that many dots.  For example the number '1' will have one dot '2' will have two dots and so on.  The dot patterns might be arranged in different formations (e.g. a straight line a square a more random arrangement) but the crucial element is the *number* of dots.

2. **Start with the easy ones:** Begin by matching the smaller numbers (1 2 3 etc.) as they are easier to count and visually verify.

3. **Systematic approach:** Proceed sequentially through the numbers from 1 to 20. For each number locate the corresponding dot pattern with the same quantity of dots.

4. **Double-check:** Once you've made all the connections take a moment to review your work.  Make sure each number is accurately paired with its dot pattern count.


In short it's a counting and visual matching activity.  Accuracy is key.  If you have any difficulty counting dots in a complex pattern try to organize the dots mentally or physically to make counting simpler."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Circle the number that has the same number of dots underneath it; for example if you see 5 dots circle the number 5.","This is a simple counting task.  Follow these steps:

1. **Count the dots:** Look at the dots below each number. Count how many dots are present for each number.

2. **Match the count to the number:**  Find the number that matches the count of dots you just made.

3. **Circle the number:** Circle the number that has the same quantity as the number of dots below it.


For example:

If you see the number ""3"" with three dots underneath it circle the ""3"".  If you see the number ""7"" with five dots underneath it you would *not* circle it. You'd continue searching until you found a number with five dots beneath it and then circle that number."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","B","Fill in the blanks with the correct number symbol that matches the dot patterns shown on the page.","To solve this task you need to identify the underlying pattern or rule connecting the dot patterns to the number symbols.  There are several possibilities depending on the specific dot patterns provided.  Here's a breakdown of how to approach it:

**1. Analyze the Dot Patterns:**

* **Counting:** The simplest approach is to simply count the dots in each pattern.  If the number of dots directly corresponds to a number symbol that's your answer.
* **Grouping:**  Look for ways the dots might be grouped.  Are they arranged in rows columns or other shapes?  The arrangement might be key to understanding the number symbol.
* **Spatial Arrangement:** Consider the spatial relationships between the dots.  Are they equally spaced?  Do they form a specific geometric shape? This information could hold the clue.
* **Combinations:**  Sometimes the pattern uses a combination of counting and grouping or spatial arrangement.  For instance the number of groups of dots might be important or the number of dots in a specific group might be relevant.

**2. Analyze the Number Symbols:**

* **Numerals:** Are the number symbols standard numerals (1 2 3 etc.)?  If so the dot patterns likely directly represent these numbers.
* **Other Symbols:** If the symbols are not standard numerals they might be representing something else entirely.  You may need to decipher their meaning based on the provided examples.  This might involve looking for patterns among the symbols themselves.


**3. Establish the Relationship:**

Once you have analyzed both the dot patterns and the number symbols try to establish a clear relationship between them.  This often involves finding a consistent rule that works for *all* the provided examples.  For example:

* **One-to-one correspondence:** Each dot corresponds to a unit of the number.
* **Grouping:**  Each group of dots represents a specific numerical value.
* **Positional value:** The position of the dots in a pattern might signify a positional value within a number system (like ones tens hundreds).


**4. Test the Rule:**

Once you've determined a potential rule test it on all the given examples to ensure it consistently works.  If the rule doesn't work for all examples you need to reconsider your approach and look for a different pattern.

**Example:**

Let's say you have these examples:

* **Pattern A:**  Three dots arranged in a row (***)  --->  Symbol: 3
* **Pattern B:**  Six dots arranged in two rows of three (*** ***) ---> Symbol: 6
* **Pattern C:**  Nine dots arranged in three rows of three (*** *** ***) ---> Symbol: 9


The rule here is clearly a one-to-one correspondence: the number of dots equals the number symbol.


**In short:**  Carefully examine the dot patterns for any type of pattern (counting grouping spatial relationships) and compare them to the provided number symbols to find the consistent rule linking them together.  Always test your discovered rule on all provided examples before filling in the blanks."

"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","A bakery sells packs of cookies for $24 each and a customer wants to buy 4 packs; use the distributive property to find the total cost.","The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac.  We can use this to solve the cookie problem in a slightly roundabout but illustrative way to demonstrate the property.

Instead of directly multiplying 4 packs * $24/pack we can break down the $24 into smaller easier-to-work-with numbers.  Let's say we break it down into $20 + $4:

1. **Rewrite the problem:** The total cost is 4 * ($20 + $4).

2. **Apply the distributive property:** This becomes (4 * $20) + (4 * $4).

3. **Solve each part:**
   * 4 * $20 = $80
   * 4 * $4 = $16

4. **Add the results:** $80 + $16 = $96

Therefore the total cost of 4 packs of cookies is $96.  While this is a longer method than simply multiplying 4 x 24 it effectively shows how the distributive property works."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","If a box contains 36 chocolates and is divided equally into 4 smaller boxes how many chocolates will be in each box using the distributive property?","The distributive property isn't strictly necessary to solve this problem but we can illustrate it.  The problem is essentially 36 ÷ 4.

**Direct Division:** The simplest way is just to divide 36 by 4:  36 ÷ 4 = 9 chocolates per box.

**Distributive Property Approach:**

Think of the 36 chocolates as groups.  We can break down the 36 into smaller easier-to-divide groups.  Let's use the distributive property to show this:

1. **Break down 36:** We can express 36 as 20 + 16 (or any other combination that's easily divisible by 4).

2. **Distribute the division:**  We can then divide each part separately:

   (20 ÷ 4) + (16 ÷ 4) = 5 + 4 = 9

Therefore each smaller box will have 9 chocolates.  This demonstrates the distributive property of division over addition.  We've distributed the division across the sum (20 + 16) and got the same result.  While this is more complex than direct division for this specific problem it illustrates how the distributive property *can* be applied."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","A gardener needs to plant 29 flowers in rows of 3; apply the distributive property to calculate the total number of flowers he needs to plant.","You can't directly use the distributive property in the *traditional* sense (a(b+c) = ab + ac) to solve this problem because the problem doesn't naturally break down into a sum of easily-divisible groups.  The distributive property is most helpful when you're dealing with multiplication involving sums or differences.

Instead the problem is asking you to think about the number 29 in terms of multiples of 3.  You could solve it in a couple of ways leveraging related mathematical concepts:

**Method 1:  Using division and multiplication (with a bit of implied distributive)**

1. **Divide:** Divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per row: 29 ÷ 3 = 9 with a remainder of 2.

2. **Interpret the Result:** This means the gardener can make 9 full rows of 3 flowers each.  The remainder of 2 represents flowers left over that won't make a full row.

3. **Calculate Total:**  The total number of flowers is (9 rows * 3 flowers/row) + 2 leftover flowers = 27 + 2 = 29 flowers.  While not explicitly distributive in the a(b+c) form the calculation of the total number from the full rows and the remainder implicitly uses a distributive-like idea.

**Method 2:  Expressing 29 as a sum involving a multiple of 3**

1. **Find a Multiple:** Find the closest multiple of 3 that's less than 29. That's 27 (3 x 9).

2. **Rewrite 29:** Rewrite 29 as a sum involving that multiple of 3: 29 = 27 + 2

3. **Calculate:**  This implicitly uses a distributive property-like approach. You could view it as 3 * (9) + 2.  This shows the 9 rows of 3 plus the remaining 2.  The total is still 29.


In short while the problem statement mentions the distributive property a direct application isn't the most efficient or natural way to solve it. The problem tests your understanding of division with remainders and how to break down a number into parts useful for solving the problem."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and representing numbers","G","Convert the fraction 3/8 into a decimal and a percentage.","To convert the fraction 3/8 into a decimal and a percentage follow these steps:

**1. Decimal:**

* **Divide the numerator by the denominator:**  Divide 3 by 8.  This can be done using long division or a calculator.
* **Result:** 3 ÷ 8 = 0.375

Therefore the decimal representation of 3/8 is 0.375.


**2. Percentage:**

* **Convert the decimal to a percentage:** Multiply the decimal by 100.
* **Add the % symbol:**  0.375 x 100 = 37.5%

"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","List all the factors of 36 and identify which of these factors are also prime numbers.","To solve this task follow these steps:

**1. Find all factors of 36:**

A factor of a number is a whole number that divides evenly into that number without leaving a remainder.  To find all the factors of 36 systematically consider all the whole numbers from 1 up to 36 checking if they divide 36 without a remainder.

You can do this by:

* **Starting with 1:** 1 is always a factor.
* **Trying successive numbers:** 2 divides 36 (36/2 = 18) so 2 and 18 are factors.  Continue with 3 (36/3 = 12) 4 (36/4 = 9) 6 (36/6 = 6) etc.
* **Pairing:** Notice that once you reach the square root of 36 (which is 6) you'll start repeating factor pairs (because 6 x 6 = 36 and you've already found 6).


Therefore the factors of 36 are: 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36.

**2. Identify the prime factors:**

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.  Now look at the list of factors you generated in step 1 and identify which ones are prime:

* **1 is not prime:** By definition prime numbers must be greater than 1.
* **2 is prime:** Its only divisors are 1 and 2.
* **3 is prime:** Its only divisors are 1 and 3.
* **4 is not prime:** It's divisible by 1 2 and 4.
* **6 is not prime:** It's divisible by 1 2 3 and 6.
* **9 is not prime:** It's divisible by 1 3 and 9.
* **12 is not prime:**  It's divisible by 1 2 3 4 6 and 12.
* **18 is not prime:** It's divisible by 1 2 3 6 9 and 18.
* **36 is not prime:** It's divisible by many numbers.

**Conclusion:**

The factors of 36 are 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36.  The prime factors of 36 are 2 and 3."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","Calculate the first five multiples of 7 and explain the pattern you observe in those multiples.","To solve this task follow these steps:

1. **Find the first five multiples of 7:**  A multiple of a number is the result of multiplying that number by an integer (whole number).  So we'll multiply 7 by the first five integers (1 2 3 4 and 5):

   * 7 x 1 = 7
   * 7 x 2 = 14
   * 7 x 3 = 21
   * 7 x 4 = 28
   * 7 x 5 = 35

2. **Observe the pattern:** Now look at the sequence of numbers you've generated: 7 14 21 28 35.  Notice the pattern:

   * **Arithmetic sequence:** The difference between consecutive numbers is always the same (7).  Each number is 7 more than the previous number. This is called an arithmetic sequence.
   * **Units digit pattern:** The units digits (the last digit of each number) follow a pattern: 7 4 1 8 5.  This pattern will repeat for subsequent multiples.
   * **Tens digit pattern (less consistent):**  The tens digits change less predictably in this short sequence but would reveal a more consistent pattern with more multiples.


Therefore your answer should include the five multiples (7 14 21 28 35) and a description of the observed patterns specifically the constant difference of 7 between consecutive multiples and the repeating pattern of the units digits."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","If you have 48 apples and want to divide them equally into baskets determine all the possible numbers of baskets you can use by finding the factors of 48.","To find all the possible numbers of baskets you can use you need to find all the factors of 48.  Factors are numbers that divide evenly into 48 without leaving a remainder.  Here's how to do it:

**Method 1:  Listing Factors Systematically**

1. **Start with 1:** 1 is always a factor of any number.  (1 basket containing 48 apples)

2. **Check for 2:** 48 is an even number so it's divisible by 2. (2 baskets with 24 apples each)

3. **Check for 3:** Add the digits of 48 (4+8=12). Since 12 is divisible by 3 48 is also divisible by 3. (3 baskets with 16 apples each)

4. **Continue with other numbers:**  Try 4 5 6 and so on.  If a number divides evenly into 48 it's a factor.  If it doesn't divide evenly move on.

5. **Stop when you reach the square root:** Once you find a factor that is larger than the square root of 48 (approximately 6.9) you've found all the factors.  Any larger factor will have a corresponding smaller factor you've already found.

6. **List your factors:**  You'll find the factors of 48 are: 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 16 24 and 48.


**Method 2: Prime Factorization**

1. **Find the prime factorization:** Express 48 as a product of prime numbers.  48 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 2⁴ x 3

2. **Generate factors:** To find all the factors consider all possible combinations of these prime factors:

   * Using only 2s: 2¹ 2² 2³ 2⁴  (2 4 8 16)
   * Using 3: 3¹ (3)
   * Combinations of 2s and 3s: 2¹ x 3¹ = 6; 2² x 3¹ = 12; 2³ x 3¹ = 24; 2⁴ x 3¹ = 48; and 1 (the combination of no prime factors)

This method ensures you find all factors without missing any.  You'll arrive at the same list as Method 1: 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 16 24 and 48.

Therefore you can use 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 16 24 or 48 baskets."

   * Multiples of 8: 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72...
   * Multiples of 12: 12 24 36 48 60 72...

2. **Identify the smallest common multiple:**  The smallest number that appears in both lists is 24.  Therefore the LCM(8 12) = 24.

**Method 2: Prime Factorization**

1. **Find the prime factorization of each number:**
   * 8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2³
   * 12 = 2 x 2 x 3 = 2² x 3

2. **Identify the highest power of each prime factor:** The prime factors are 2 and 3. The highest power of 2 is 2³ (from the factorization of 8) and the highest power of 3 is 3¹ (from the factorization of 12).

3. **Multiply the highest powers together:** LCM(8 12) = 2³ x 3 = 8 x 3 = 24

**Method 3: Using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**

1. **Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 12:** You can use the Euclidean algorithm or prime factorization for this.  Using prime factorization:
   * 8 = 2³
   * 12 = 2² x 3
   * The common factors are 2² so GCD(8 12) = 4

2. **Use the formula: LCM(a b) = (a x b) / GCD(a b)**
   * LCM(8 12) = (8 x 12) / 4 = 96 / 4 = 24

**How often their multiples coincide:**

The LCM of 8 and 12 is 24.  This means that the multiples of 8 and 12 will coincide every 24 units.  In other words every 24th multiple of 8 will also be a multiple of 12 and vice versa.  For example:

* Multiples of 8: 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 72...
* Multiples of 12: 12 24 36 48 60 72...

The common multiples are 24 48 72...  They coincide every 24 units."

**1. Listing Factors:**

* **Find the factors of 20:** 1 2 4 5 10 20
* **Find the factors of 30:** 1 2 3 5 6 10 15 30
* **Identify the common factors:** 1 2 5 10
* **The greatest common factor (which is the GCD) is 10.**

This method is straightforward for smaller numbers but becomes cumbersome with larger numbers.

**2. Prime Factorization:**

* **Find the prime factorization of 20:** 2² x 5
* **Find the prime factorization of 30:** 2 x 3 x 5
* **Identify the common prime factors:** 2 and 5
* **Multiply the common prime factors to the lowest power they appear in either factorization:** 2¹ x 5¹ = 10
* **The GCD is 10.**

This method is more efficient for larger numbers than listing all factors.

**3. Euclidean Algorithm:**

This is the most efficient method for larger numbers.  It involves repeatedly applying the division algorithm until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

1. Divide the larger number (30) by the smaller number (20): 30 ÷ 20 = 1 with a remainder of 10.
2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (20) and the smaller number with the remainder (10):  20 ÷ 10 = 2 with a remainder of 0.
3. Since the remainder is 0 the GCD is the last non-zero remainder which is 10.

Therefore the greatest common divisor of 20 and 30 is $\boxed{10}$."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","A gardener wants to plant flowers in rows using 18 red flowers and 24 blue flowers; what is the LCM of 18 and 24 to find the smallest number of total flowers he can use without having leftovers?","The gardener wants to arrange both red and blue flowers in equal-sized rows without any flowers left over.  This means the number of rows must be a common divisor of both 18 and 24.  To find the *largest* possible number of rows (and thus the *smallest* number of total flowers) we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 24.

However the problem states we need to use the *least common multiple* (LCM). The LCM is used to find the smallest number of *total flowers* needed. Here's why the LCM is relevant:

* **Rows of Red Flowers:**  The gardener can arrange 18 red flowers in rows of 1 2 3 6 9 or 18 flowers per row.
* **Rows of Blue Flowers:** The gardener can arrange 24 blue flowers in rows of 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 or 24 flowers per row.

To have the same number of flowers in each row for both colors the number of flowers per row must be a common divisor of both 18 and 24. The *largest* such common divisor is the GCD(18 24) = 6.

If he uses 6 flowers per row:

* He'll have 18 red flowers / 6 flowers/row = 3 rows of red flowers.
* He'll have 24 blue flowers / 6 flowers/row = 4 rows of blue flowers.

This isn't what we want; he needs the *same* number of rows for both colors.  This is where the LCM comes in.

The LCM(18 24) gives us the smallest number of *flowers per color* that allows for a whole number of rows of equal size for both colors.  We find the LCM as follows:

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   * 18 = 2 x 3 x 3 = 2 x 3²
   * 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 2³ x 3

2. **LCM Calculation:** To find the LCM take the highest power of each prime factor present in either number:
   * LCM(18 24) = 2³ x 3² = 8 x 9 = 72

Therefore the smallest number of *total* flowers he can use without leftovers is 72.  He'll have 4 rows of 18 red flowers (72 total red flowers) and 3 rows of 24 blue flowers (72 total blue flowers) resulting in 72 flowers total.  Each row will contain 18 red and 24 blue flowers.  The total number of flowers per row will be 42."

1. **Understand the scale:** The scale 1:250 means that 1 unit of measurement on the model represents 250 units of the same measurement on the actual skyscraper.

2. **Convert units:**  The skyscraper's height is given in meters but we want the model's height in centimeters.  There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. Therefore the actual height of the skyscraper is 300 meters * 100 cm/meter = 30000 centimeters.

**1. Estimate the discount:**

* **Shirts:** 3 shirts * $25/shirt = $75.  15% of $75 is roughly 10% ($7.50) + half of 10% ($3.75) ≈ $11.25  (This is a little under but close enough for an estimate)
* **Shoes:** 2 pairs * $40/pair = $80. 15% of $80 is roughly 10% ($8) + half of 10% ($4) = $12

**2. Estimate the total discount:**

* Total estimated discount: $11.25 (shirts) + $12 (shoes) ≈ $23.25

**3. Estimate the total pre-discount cost:**

* Total pre-discount cost: $75 (shirts) + $80 (shoes) = $155

**4. Estimate the final cost:**

* Estimated final cost: $155 - $23.25 ≈ $132

**5. Precise Calculation (for comparison):**

* **Shirts:**  $25 * 0.15 = $3.75 discount per shirt; $3.75 * 3 shirts = $11.25 total shirt discount.  $75 - $11.25 = $63.75 final shirt cost.
* **Shoes:** $40 * 0.15 = $6 discount per pair; $6 * 2 pairs = $12 total shoe discount. $80 - $12 = $68 final shoe cost.
* **Total cost:** $63.75 + $68 = $131.75

**Conclusion:**

Our estimate of $132 was very close to the precise calculation of $131.75.  This demonstrates that using estimation with a bit of mental math can be a quick and effective way to get a good idea of the final cost without needing a calculator for every step."

"Numbers and operations","Applying calculation strategies","F","You have $250 saved for tickets to a concert with each ticket costing approximately $67; estimate how many tickets you can buy and how much money you will have left over.","To solve this you can use estimation to make the calculation simpler.

**1. Estimate the number of tickets:**

* Round the ticket price down to $60 to make the calculation easier.  This is a reasonable simplification since the actual price is only slightly higher.
* Divide your total savings by the estimated ticket price: $250 / $60 ≈ 4.  This means you can likely buy about 4 tickets.


**2. Calculate the estimated cost:**

* Multiply the estimated number of tickets by the rounded ticket price: 4 tickets * $60/ticket = $240

**3.  Calculate the estimated leftover money:**

* Subtract the estimated cost from your total savings: $250 - $240 = $10

**4. Refine the estimate (optional):**

Since we rounded the ticket price down our estimate is likely slightly high on the number of tickets.  Let's check with the actual ticket price:

* 4 tickets * $67/ticket = $268.  This is more than we have.

Therefore you can only afford 3 tickets. Let's calculate the leftover money with the actual price:

* 3 tickets * $67/ticket = $201
* $250 - $201 = $49

**Conclusion:**

You can buy approximately 3 tickets and you will have approximately $49 left over.  The initial estimation provided a good starting point but refining it with the actual price gave a more precise answer."

1. **Calculate the cost of two dozen cookies without the discount:**

   * One dozen cookies is 12 cookies.
   * Two dozen cookies is 2 * 12 = 24 cookies.
   * The cost of 24 cookies at $2.50 each is 24 * $2.50 = $60.00

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**

   * The discount is 15% of the cost of a dozen cookies.
   * Since you're buying two dozen you get the discount twice.
   * Cost of one dozen: 12 cookies * $2.50/cookie = $30.00
   * Discount per dozen: $30.00 * 0.15 = $4.50
   * Total discount for two dozen: $4.50 * 2 = $9.00

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**

   * Total cost before discount: $60.00
   * Total discount: $9.00
   * Total cost after discount: $60.00 - $9.00 = $51.00

Therefore the total cost after the discount for two dozen cookies is $\boxed{$51.00}$"

"Space and form","Spatial orientation and positional relationships","B","Draw a picture of a cat that is sitting below a tree and a bird that is beside the tree.","To draw this picture you'll want to break it down into manageable steps:

**1. Planning and Sketching:**

* **Composition:**  Decide where you want the tree cat and bird to be positioned on your paper. A simple sketch helps. Consider the overall balance of the picture.  Would a centered tree work or would an off-center placement be more visually interesting?
* **Tree:** Start with a light sketch of the tree.  Keep it simple – a trunk with a few branches reaching upwards. Don't worry about perfect detail at this stage. You could use basic shapes like cylinders and ovals as guides.
* **Cat:**  Sketch the cat sitting below the tree. Again use simple shapes initially – a circle for the body an oval for the head.  Add basic outlines for the legs and tail.  Think about the cat's pose – is it curled up sitting upright etc.?
* **Bird:** Sketch the bird next to the tree.  Use simple shapes for the body and head. Note the position of its wings and tail.

**2. Refining the Sketch:**

* **Details:** Once you have the basic shapes start adding more details. Add fur texture to the cat (short strokes for short fur longer strokes for longer fur). Add leaves and branches to the tree making some branches thicker than others to create depth. Detail the bird's feathers beak and eyes.
* **Proportions:** Check the proportions of your drawings. Does the cat look too big or small compared to the tree? Is the bird realistically sized? Make adjustments as needed.
* **Overlapping:** Make sure the tree cat and bird overlap realistically.  The branches of the tree might partially obscure the cat and parts of the cat might be hidden behind the tree trunk.


**3. Adding Value and Shading:**

* **Light Source:** Decide on a light source (e.g. the sun). This will determine where the shadows fall.
* **Shading:** Add shading to create depth and volume.  Darker areas indicate shadows while lighter areas indicate where the light hits. Use darker shading under the cat's chin behind the tree trunk and under the bird's wings.
* **Texture:** Use shading to create texture.  The cat's fur should have a different texture than the tree bark or the bird's feathers.


**4. Final Touches:**

* **Background:**  Consider adding a simple background like grass or a sky. This will help the picture feel more complete.
* **Outline (Optional):** You might choose to outline your drawing with a darker pen or marker but this is optional.  A clean unoutlined drawing can also look great.
* **Erase Guidelines:** Carefully erase your initial sketch lines.


**Materials:**

* Pencil (for sketching)
* Eraser

    * **J(5 5):**  vector<sub>J</sub> = (5 - 3 5 - 3) = (2 2)
    * **K(5 1):**  vector<sub>K</sub> = (5 - 3 1 - 3) = (2 -2)

**2. Rotate the vectors 180 degrees:**

A 180-degree rotation reverses the direction of a vector.  This means we simply multiply each component of the vector by -1:

    * **Rotated vector<sub>H</sub>:** (-1 * -2 -1 * -2) = (2 2)
    * **Rotated vector<sub>I</sub>:** (-1 * -2 -1 * 2) = (2 -2)
    * **Rotated vector<sub>J</sub>:** (-1 * 2 -1 * 2) = (-2 -2)
    * **Rotated vector<sub>K</sub>:** (-1 * 2 -1 * -2) = (-2 2)


**3. Add the rotated vectors back to the center of rotation:**

To find the new coordinates of each vertex after the rotation add the rotated vector to the coordinates of the center of rotation (3 3):

    * **H':** (3 + 2 3 + 2) = (5 5)
    * **I':** (3 + 2 3 - 2) = (5 1)
    * **J':** (3 - 2 3 - 2) = (1 1)
    * **K':** (3 - 2 3 + 2) = (1 5)

**Therefore the new coordinates of the vertices are:**

* H': (5 5)
* I': (5 1)
* J': (1 1)
* K': (1 5)

Notice that the square has effectively been rotated 180 degrees around the point (3 3).  The vertices have swapped positions."

Here's how to do it for your vertices:

* **Original Vertex (2 3):**
    * New x-coordinate: 2 - 2 = 0
    * New y-coordinate: 3 - 3 = 0
    * **New Vertex: (0 0)**

* **Original Vertex (4 5):**
    * New x-coordinate: 4 - 2 = 2
    * New y-coordinate: 5 - 3 = 2
    * **New Vertex: (2 2)**

* **Original Vertex (3 7):**
    * New x-coordinate: 3 - 2 = 1
    * New y-coordinate: 7 - 3 = 4
    * **New Vertex: (1 4)**

Therefore the new vertices of the translated triangle are **(0 0) (2 2) and (1 4)**."

The y-coordinate remains the same.

* **(1 1):** Reflecting across the y-axis gives you **(-1 1)**.
* **(1 4):** Reflecting across the y-axis gives you **(-1 4)**.
* **(4 1):** Reflecting across the y-axis gives you **(-4 1)**.
* **(4 4):** Reflecting across the y-axis gives you **(-4 4)**.

Therefore the coordinates of the reflected rectangle are **(-1 1) (-1 4) (-4 1) and (-4 4)**."
"Space and form","Spatial orientation and positional relationships","F","A quadrilateral is positioned with vertices at (5 2) (5 6) (8 2) and (8 6); apply a translation of three units right and two units up and sketch the resulting figure.","This task involves applying a translation to a quadrilateral.  A translation simply moves every point of the shape the same distance and direction.  Here's how to solve it:

**1. Understand the starting quadrilateral:**

The vertices are:

* A = (5 2)
* B = (5 6)
* C = (8 2)
* D = (8 6)

Notice that this is a rectangle. Plotting these points will show you this.

**2. Apply the translation:**

The translation is three units to the right and two units up.  This means we add 3 to the x-coordinate and 2 to the y-coordinate of each vertex.

* **A' (A prime):** (5 + 3 2 + 2) = (8 4)
* **B' (B prime):** (5 + 3 6 + 2) = (8 8)
* **C' (C prime):** (8 + 3 2 + 2) = (11 4)
* **D' (D prime):** (8 + 3 6 + 2) = (11 8)

**3. Sketch the resulting figure:**

Now you have the coordinates of the translated quadrilateral: A'(8 4) B'(8 8) C'(11 4) D'(11 8).  Draw a coordinate plane (x and y axes) and plot these four points. Connect the points in order (A' to B' to C' to D' and back to A') to form the translated rectangle.

You'll find that the new rectangle is the same size and shape as the original but it's shifted three units to the right and two units up.


In short:  The key is to add the translation values (32) to each original coordinate to find the new coordinates and then plot those new coordinates to draw the translated shape."

**Method 1: Using physical materials (pencils crayons colored pencils paints etc.)**

1. **Draw the Triangle:**  On a piece of paper lightly sketch a large triangle.  Make it as large as you want within the bounds of your paper.  Aim for a roughly equilateral triangle (all sides about the same length) or an isosceles triangle (two sides the same length) for a balanced look but any triangle will do.

2. **Color the Triangle Red:** Use your red crayon colored pencil or paint to completely fill in the triangle you've drawn.

3. **Draw the Square:**  Next to the triangle draw a square.  Make it noticeably smaller than the triangle or larger depending on your preference.  Try to make the sides of the square relatively even.

4. **Color the Square Blue:** Use your blue crayon colored pencil or paint to completely fill in the square.


**Method 2: Using digital drawing software (e.g. MS Paint Adobe Photoshop Krita etc.)**

1. **Open your software:** Launch your chosen drawing program.

2. **Create a new canvas:**  Select a size that will comfortably fit both your triangle and square.

3. **Draw the Triangle:** Use the shape tool (often a polygon tool) to draw a large red triangle.  Most programs allow you to specify the number of sides and the fill color. Choose red as your fill color.

4. **Draw the Square:** Use the shape tool to draw a blue square. Select blue as your fill color.  Position it where you want it on the canvas separate from the triangle.


**Regardless of method:**

* **Neatness:** Try your best to keep the lines clean and the colors even.  It's okay if it's not perfect; the goal is to understand and complete the instructions.
* **Size:**  The instructions say ""large"" triangle but that's relative.  Just make sure the triangle is bigger than the square.
* **Arrangement:** You can place the triangle and square wherever you like on the page or canvas.


The core of the task is simply practicing basic shapes and coloring.  Focus on following each instruction one step at a time."
"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","B","Find and color all the circles in this picture green.","You can't solve this task using just a text-based explanation.  This requires image processing capabilities.  To find and color all the circles in a picture green you'll need a program or software that can:

1. **Image Input:** Load the image into the program.

2. **Circle Detection:**  This is the core of the problem.  Several algorithms can detect circles:

    * **Hough Transform:** A classic computer vision technique that's relatively robust to noise.  It works by identifying points in the image that lie on potential circles and grouping them.  The parameters (like radius range) need to be tuned depending on the image.

    * **Edge Detection followed by Circle Fitting:**  First detect edges in the image (e.g. using the Canny edge detector). Then look for sets of edge points that form circles.  Least squares fitting can be used to estimate the circle's parameters (center and radius).

    * **Machine Learning:** If you have a large dataset of images with labeled circles you could train a machine learning model (like a convolutional neural network or CNN) to detect circles. This approach is generally more accurate but requires significant data and computational resources.

3. **Coloring:** Once circles are detected (their centers and radii are known) the program needs to fill those circular regions with green color.  This involves iterating through the pixels within each detected circle's boundary and setting their color to green (e.g. RGB value of 0 255 0).

**Software/Tools you could use:**

* **Python with OpenCV:**  A very popular combination. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) has functions for image input Hough Transform edge detection and color manipulation.  You'd write a Python script to use these functions.

* **ImageJ/Fiji:** A free Java-based image processing program with plugins that might offer circle detection capabilities.

* **MATLAB:** A commercial software package with extensive image processing toolboxes.

* **Specialized AI platforms:** Some cloud-based AI platforms (like Google Cloud Vision API or Amazon Rekognition) might offer circle detection as a pre-trained model.

In summary you can't just *describe* how to solve this; you need to use a programming language and a computer vision library to implement the algorithm.  The choice of algorithm and software depends on factors like the complexity of the image the accuracy required and your programming skills."
"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","B","Look at the shapes in the box and color all the squares purple.","To solve this task you need to identify which shapes within the box are squares.  Remember that a square is a shape with:

* **Four sides:**  It must have four straight sides.
* **All sides equal in length:**  All four sides must be the same length.
* **Four right angles:** Each corner must be a perfect 90-degree angle (a square corner).

Once you've identified all the shapes that meet these criteria color them purple.  Ignore any other shapes that aren't squares."
"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","C","Draw a rectangle and label its four sides and two right angles.","Here's how to solve the task:

1. **Draw the Rectangle:** Use a ruler to draw two parallel lines of equal length. These will be opposite sides of your rectangle.  Then draw two more parallel lines of equal length connecting the ends of the first two lines.  Make sure these new lines are perpendicular (forming right angles) to the first two. You now have a rectangle.

2. **Label the Sides:**  Label each side with a different letter (e.g. a b c d) or a different descriptive name (e.g. length width length width).  Opposite sides of a rectangle have equal lengths.

3. **Label the Right Angles:**  Indicate the four right angles using the right angle symbol (a small square) in each corner where the lines meet.  This symbol clearly shows that the angle measures 90 degrees.


That's it! You've successfully drawn a rectangle and labeled its sides and right angles. Remember to use a ruler for straight lines to make it accurate."
"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","C","Sketch a triangle with different side lengths and mark its three angles as acute right or obtuse.","You can't have a triangle with *both* a right angle and different side lengths and also have *all* angles classified as acute or obtuse.  A triangle can only have one right angle (90°) or one obtuse angle (>90°). The other angles must be acute (<90°).

Here's how to approach the task correctly focusing on the different scenarios:

**1. Triangle with three acute angles (acute triangle):**

* **Sketch:** Draw a triangle where all three angles appear to be less than 90°.  Make sure the sides are visibly different lengths.  One side should be clearly longer than the other two for instance.
* **Mark the angles:** Label each angle with ""acute"".

**2. Triangle with one right angle (right-angled triangle):**

* **Sketch:** Draw a triangle where one angle is clearly a right angle (90°). Use a square corner symbol to emphasize this. The other two sides should be different lengths.
* **Mark the angles:** Label the right angle ""right"" and label the other two angles ""acute"".

**3. Triangle with one obtuse angle (obtuse triangle):**

* **Sketch:** Draw a triangle where one angle appears to be greater than 90°.  Make it noticeably larger than a right angle. Again ensure the sides have different lengths.
* **Mark the angles:** Label the obtuse angle ""obtuse"" and the other two angles ""acute.""

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","C","Create a square and identify its four equal sides and the four right angles by labeling them.","You can solve this task using either physical materials or digital tools. Here's how to approach it both ways:

**Method 1: Using Physical Materials (e.g. paper ruler protractor)**

1. **Draw a square:** Using a ruler draw a straight line.  Measure a length you want your square to be (e.g. 5cm).  Draw another line of the same length perpendicular to the first one (use the corner of a ruler to ensure a 90-degree angle).

2. **Complete the square:** From the end of each of the two lines you've drawn draw two more lines of the same length connecting them to form a closed square. Again use the ruler to make sure these lines are straight and the same length as the first two.

3. **Label the sides:** Label each of the four sides with a letter (e.g. a b c d) or a number (1 2 3 4) to show they are equal.  You can write ""a = b = c = d"" next to the square to explicitly indicate equality.

4. **Label the angles:** Use a protractor to verify each angle is 90 degrees.  Label each angle with a right angle symbol (a small square in the corner) or write ""90°"" next to each angle.

**Method 2: Using Digital Tools (e.g. geometry software like GeoGebra or even drawing software like MS Paint)**

1. **Use a square tool (if available):** Most geometry software has a tool specifically for creating squares.  Use this tool to draw a square. The software will automatically ensure all sides are equal and angles are 90 degrees.

2. **Manual construction (if necessary):** If your software doesn't have a dedicated square tool you can construct it using the line segment tool and perpendicular line tool.  Start by drawing a line segment. Then use the perpendicular line tool to draw a line of equal length perpendicular to one end of the segment. Complete the square by drawing two more line segments connecting the endpoints.

3. **Labeling:** Use the labeling tools within the software to label each side with the same letter or number to indicate their equality.  Similarly label each angle with a right angle symbol or the number 90°.


**In either method the key is to:**

* **Ensure equal sides:** All four sides must have the same length.
* **Ensure right angles:** All four angles must be 90 degrees (right angles).
* **Clear labeling:**  Clearly label the sides to show their equality and label the angles to show they are right angles.

2. **Choose a corner:** Select one of the four corners of your square.

3. **Draw the right angle indicator:**  Within that chosen corner draw a small arc or a small square to visually represent the 90-degree angle.  You can make a small quarter-circle inside the corner.

4. **Label the angle:** Next to the arc or square you just drew neatly write ""Right Angle"".


That's it! You've successfully drawn a right angle in the corner of a square and labeled it.  The key is to make the square reasonably accurate and clearly indicate the 90-degree angle in the corner."

1. **Identify the Angles:**  Look at the three angles in your triangle.  Each angle is formed where two sides of the triangle meet.

2. **Visual Estimation:**  Visually compare each angle to a right angle (90 degrees).  A right angle looks like the corner of a square.  If an angle is clearly smaller than a right angle it's acute.

3. **Select an Acute Angle:** Choose *one* of the angles that appears smaller than 90 degrees.

4. **Shade and Label:** Shade the angle you chose using a pencil or highlighter.  Then clearly write ""Acute Angle"" next to or inside the shaded area.


If you're unsure about the size of an angle just by looking at it you might need additional tools or information (like the angle measurements) to definitively identify an acute angle.  But for most simple triangles visual estimation will suffice for this task."

The corner where they meet forms a perfect 90-degree right angle. Label this angle with a small square in the corner to indicate a right angle and write ""90°"" next to it.

2. **Create a Second Right Angle:** Extend one of the lines you already drew (either the horizontal or vertical one) further.  Then draw another line perpendicular (at a 90-degree angle) to this extended line.  This creates a second 90-degree right angle. Label this angle with a small square and ""90°"".

3. **Add an Acute Angle:** Now draw a third line that intersects one of your existing lines at an angle *smaller* than 90 degrees. This is your acute angle (an angle less than 90°).  It doesn't have to be a specific measurement like 30° or 45°; just make sure it's clearly less than a right angle.  Label this angle with a curved arc and write ""Acute Angle"" or a specific measurement if you can determine one using a protractor (though that isn't strictly required by the instructions).


**Example Shape:**

You could end up with a shape like an L-shape with a triangle added to one side or a sort of irregular quadrilateral.

**1. Draw the line segment:**

* Use your ruler to draw a straight line segment.  Make it slightly longer than 8cm to give yourself room for error.
* Carefully measure 8cm along the line using your ruler. Mark the start point as A and the endpoint as B.

**2. Find the midpoint using a compass (most accurate method):**

* **Open the compass:** Set the compass radius to slightly more than half the length of AB (a radius of about 5cm would work well).  It doesn't have to be exactly half but more than half is crucial.
* **Place the compass point on A:** Draw an arc above and below the line segment AB.
* **Place the compass point on B (without changing the radius):** Draw another set of arcs above and below the line segment AB intersecting the arcs you drew from point A.
* **Draw the midpoint:** Draw a straight line connecting the two points where the arcs intersect. This line will cross the line segment AB at its exact midpoint M.


**3. Find the midpoint using a ruler (less accurate method):**

* **Measure the length:** Measure the length of AB (it should be 8cm).
* **Divide by two:** Divide the length by two (8cm / 2 = 4cm).
* **Mark the midpoint:**  Using your ruler measure 4cm from point A along the line segment AB and mark this point as M. This method is less accurate because even small inconsistencies in measurement will affect the midpoint's precision.


**Verification:**

After marking the midpoint M measure the distances AM and MB. They should both be approximately 4cm.  Any slight discrepancies are due to the limitations of your tools and drawing precision.  The compass method will generally give you a more precise result."

* Draw a line segment CD of length 10cm.

**2. Set the compass:**

* Place the compass point on point C.
* Set the compass radius to more than half the length of CD (so more than 5cm).  A larger radius is generally better for accuracy.

**3. Draw arcs:**

* Draw an arc above and below the line segment CD.

**4. Repeat with point D:**

* Without changing the compass radius place the compass point on point D.
* Draw two more arcs one above and one below the line segment CD.  These arcs should intersect the arcs you drew in step 3.

**5. Identify intersection points:**

* You should now have two points where the arcs intersect above and below the line segment. Label these points A and B.

**6. Draw the bisector:**

* Use your straightedge to draw a straight line through points A and B.  This line is the perpendicular bisector of line segment CD.

**7. Label intersection points:**

* The point where the line AB intersects the line segment CD is the midpoint of CD. Label this point M.

**1. Create Points E and F:**

* Simply mark two points on your paper.  Label one point ""E"" and the other ""F"".  These can be anywhere on the paper; it doesn't matter how far apart they are initially.

**2. Measure the Distance EF:**

* Use a ruler to measure the distance between points E and F. Record this measurement.

**3. Find the Midpoint N:**

* **Method 1: Using the Measurement:**  Take the measurement you recorded in step 2 and divide it by 2. This gives you the distance from either E or F to the midpoint N.  Using your ruler measure this distance from point E along the line segment EF. Mark this point and label it ""N"".

* **Method 2: Using a Compass:**
    * Place the compass point on point E.
    * Set the compass width to slightly *more* than half the estimated distance between E and F.  (It's better to err on the side of too wide than too narrow)
    * Draw an arc above and below the line segment EF.
    * Without changing the compass width place the compass point on point F.
    * Draw another set of arcs above and below the line segment EF intersecting the first set of arcs.
    * Draw a straight line connecting the two intersection points of the arcs. This line will intersect the line segment EF at point N the midpoint.

**4. Draw the Bisector:**

* The line you drew connecting the intersection points of the arcs in Method 2 *is* the perpendicular bisector.  If you used Method 1 draw a line that passes through point N and is perpendicular (at a 90-degree angle) to the line segment EF.  You can use a set square or protractor to ensure the 90-degree angle.  This line is the perpendicular bisector.

**In short:** Method 2 (using a compass) is more accurate for finding the midpoint and ensuring the perpendicular bisector especially if your initial points E and F are far apart or your ruler measurements are imprecise.  Method 1 is quicker if precision isn't paramount.  Either method will correctly bisect the segment."

1. **Draw a Coordinate Grid:**  Start by drawing a coordinate grid (x and y axes).  You can do this on graph paper or use online graphing tools.  Make sure your axes are labeled and have some number markings (at least up to 6 in both the x and y directions since your coordinates use values up to 5).

2. **Plot the Points:**  Locate and plot each point on your grid using its (x y) coordinates:

   * **A(2 3):** Go 2 units to the right on the x-axis and 3 units up on the y-axis.  Mark this point as A.
   * **B(5 5):** Go 5 units to the right on the x-axis and 5 units up on the y-axis. Mark this point as B.
   * **C(4 1):** Go 4 units to the right on the x-axis and 1 unit up on the y-axis. Mark this point as C.
   * **D(1 2):** Go 1 unit to the right on the x-axis and 2 units up on the y-axis. Mark this point as D.

3. **Connect the Points:**  Connect points A B C and D in that order with straight lines.  You should now have a closed shape.

4. **Identify the Polygon:** Observe the shape you've created. Count the number of sides.  The number of sides will help you name the polygon. In this case you'll have a four-sided polygon (quadrilateral). Further examine the angles and sides to see if it's a special type of quadrilateral (like a square rectangle parallelogram trapezoid or rhombus).  It's unlikely to be a regular shape with all equal sides and angles.  It’s most likely an irregular quadrilateral.

**1. Draw the Coordinate Grid:**

Draw a set of x and y axes.  Number the axes ensuring you have enough space to plot the points (at least from 0 to 5 on both x and y would be sufficient).

**2. Plot the Points:**

* **J(1 1):** Start at the origin (00). Move 1 unit to the right (along the x-axis) and 1 unit up (along the y-axis).  Place a point and label it J.
* **K(4 1):** From the origin move 4 units to the right and 1 unit up. Place a point and label it K.
* **L(4 4):** From the origin move 4 units to the right and 4 units up. Place a point and label it L.
* **M(1 4):** From the origin move 1 unit to the right and 4 units up. Place a point and label it M.

**3. Connect the Points:**

Draw lines connecting the points in the order J-K-L-M-J.  You should form a closed shape.

**4. Describe the Shape:**

Observe the shape you've created.  You'll notice that it's a **square**.  All sides are equal in length and all angles are 90 degrees.

**5. Calculate the Perimeter:**

* **Find the length of one side:**  Let's take the side JK.  The x-coordinate changes from 1 to 4 (a difference of 3) while the y-coordinate remains constant at 1.  Therefore the length of JK is 3 units.  You can verify this by calculating the distance between points J and K using the distance formula (which is unnecessary in this simple case because the lines are parallel to the axes) but visually inspecting the graph is sufficient.
* **Calculate the perimeter:** Since it's a square all four sides are equal in length (3 units). The perimeter is the sum of all side lengths: Perimeter = 4 * side length = 4 * 3 = 12 units.


Therefore the shape is a square and its perimeter is 12 units."

**2. Use the point-slope form to find the equation of each line:**

Now use the slope and one of the points for each line segment to find the equation:

* **Line AB:** Using point A(2 3) and m_AB = 4/3:
   y - 3 = (4/3)(x - 2)
   y = (4/3)x - 8/3 + 3
   y = (4/3)x + 1/3

* **Line BC:** Using point B(5 7) and m_BC = 6:
   y - 7 = 6(x - 5)
   y = 6x - 30 + 7
   y = 6x - 23

* **Line AC:** Using point A(2 3) and m_AC = -1:
   y - 3 = -1(x - 2)
   y = -x + 2 + 3
   y = -x + 5

**Therefore the equations of the lines forming the sides of the triangle are:**

* **AB:** y = (4/3)x + 1/3
* **BC:** y = 6x - 23
* **AC:** y = -x + 5

We'll find the slope and y-intercept for each side of the rectangle.

**1. Find the Slopes:**

Let's label the vertices:

* A = (-1 -2)
* B = (-1 2)
* C = (3 2)
* D = (3 -2)

The slope (m) between two points (x1 y1) and (x2 y2) is calculated as:  m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

* **Slope of AB:** m = (2 - (-2)) / (-1 - (-1)) = 4/0  This is undefined indicating a vertical line.
* **Slope of BC:** m = (2 - 2) / (3 - (-1)) = 0/4 = 0 This indicates a horizontal line.
* **Slope of CD:** m = (-2 - 2) / (3 - 3) = -4/0 This is undefined indicating a vertical line.
* **Slope of DA:** m = (-2 - (-2)) / (-1 - 3) = 0/-4 = 0 This indicates a horizontal line.


**2. Determine the Equations:**

* **Line AB (vertical):**  Vertical lines have the equation x = constant. Since the x-coordinate of both A and B is -1 the equation is  `x = -1`

* **Line BC (horizontal):** Horizontal lines have the equation y = constant. Since the y-coordinate of both B and C is 2 the equation is `y = 2`

* **Line CD (vertical):**  Similar to AB the x-coordinate is 3 so the equation is `x = 3`

* **Line DA (horizontal):** Similar to BC the y-coordinate is -2 so the equation is `y = -2`


**Therefore the equations of the four sides of the rectangle are:**

* x = -1
* y = 2
* x = 3
* y = -2


You can verify this by plotting the points and lines on a graph.  Each equation will correspond to one side of the rectangle."

**Two-Point Form:**  (y - y₁) = m(x - x₁) where 'm' is the slope and (x₁ y₁) is one of the points.

The slope 'm' is calculated as: m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)  where (x₁ y₁) and (x₂ y₂) are two points on the line.

Let's label the vertices of your hexagon:

A = (1 1)
B = (3 2)
C = (4 0)
D = (3 -2)
E = (1 -1)
F = (0 0)

Now let's find the equation for each line segment connecting adjacent vertices:

1. **Line AB:**
   * Points: (1 1) and (3 2)
   * Slope: m = (2 - 1) / (3 - 1) = 1/2
   * Equation: (y - 1) = (1/2)(x - 1)  =>  y = (1/2)x + 1/2

2. **Line BC:**
   * Points: (3 2) and (4 0)
   * Slope: m = (0 - 2) / (4 - 3) = -2
   * Equation: (y - 2) = -2(x - 3) => y = -2x + 8

3. **Line CD:**
   * Points: (4 0) and (3 -2)
   * Slope: m = (-2 - 0) / (3 - 4) = 2
   * Equation: (y - 0) = 2(x - 4) => y = 2x - 8

4. **Line DE:**
   * Points: (3 -2) and (1 -1)
   * Slope: m = (-1 - (-2)) / (1 - 3) = -1/2
   * Equation: (y - (-2)) = (-1/2)(x - 3) => y = (-1/2)x - 1/2

5. **Line EF:**
   * Points: (1 -1) and (0 0)
   * Slope: m = (0 - (-1)) / (0 - 1) = -1
   * Equation: (y - (-1)) = -1(x - 1) => y = -x

6. **Line FA:**
   * Points: (0 0) and (1 1)
   * Slope: m = (1 - 0) / (1 - 0) = 1
   * Equation: (y - 0) = 1(x - 0) => y = x

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","H","Construct an equilateral triangle with a side length of 8 cm using a compass and straightedge.","Here's how to construct an equilateral triangle with 8cm sides using a compass and straightedge:

**1. Draw the Base:**

* Use your straightedge to draw a straight line segment.  This will be the base of your equilateral triangle.
* Using your ruler measure and mark a point A on the line.  From point A measure and mark a point B 8cm away.  Segment AB is the base of your triangle.

**2. Set the Compass:**

* Adjust your compass to a width of 8 cm.  This is crucial; it needs to be precisely the same length as your base.  Place the compass point on point A.

**3. Draw the First Arc:**

* Keeping the compass width at 8 cm draw a large arc above the line segment AB.  This arc should extend significantly above the line.

**4. Draw the Second Arc:**

* Without changing the compass width move the compass point to point B.
* Draw another large arc above the line segment AB intersecting the first arc.  The point where the two arcs intersect is crucial.

**5. Locate the Third Vertex:**

* The point where the two arcs intersect (let's call it point C) is the third vertex of your equilateral triangle.

**6. Draw the Sides:**

* Use your straightedge to draw a straight line from point A to point C.
* Use your straightedge to draw a straight line from point B to point C.

**You now have an equilateral triangle ABC with sides of 8 cm each.**  All three sides are equal in length and all three angles are 60 degrees.


**Why this works:**

This construction works because the arcs you draw create points that are equidistant (8cm) from both points A and B. The only points that satisfy this condition are the points that form an equilateral triangle with A and B as the other two vertices.  The method relies on the properties of circles and the definition of an equilateral triangle."
"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","H","Draw a circle with a radius of 5 cm centered at point A then construct a tangent line to the circle at point B on its circumference using only a straightedge and compass.","Here's how to construct a tangent line to a circle at a given point using only a straightedge and compass:

**1. Draw the Circle and Identify the Point:**

* Draw a circle with a radius of 5 cm centered at point A.
* Mark a point B anywhere on the circumference of the circle.  This is the point where the tangent line will touch the circle.

**2. Extend the Radius:**

* Draw a line segment from point A (the center of the circle) through point B.  Extend this line beyond point B. This is your radius line.

**3. Construct a Perpendicular Line:**

This is the key step. A tangent line is always perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.  We'll use the compass to construct a perpendicular line:

* **Step 3a:** Place the compass point on B. Set the compass radius to a convenient length (it doesn't have to be a specific measurement just something that will allow you to comfortably intersect your extended radius line in two points. Draw an arc intersecting the extended radius line on both sides of B.  Label these intersections C and D.
* **Step 3b:** Adjust the compass radius to be somewhat larger (about 2/3 the distance between C and D will work well). Put the compass point on C and draw an arc above and/or below the extended radius.  Do the same thing with the compass point on D.  These arcs should intersect at two points (call these E and F).  A good practice is to do more than one intersection to minimize your error.
* **Step 3c:** Draw a line using the straightedge through E and F.  This line will be perpendicular to the radius line at point B. This perpendicular line is your tangent.

**4. The Tangent Line:**

The line you've just constructed (EF) is the tangent line to the circle at point B.  It only touches the circle at point B.


**Why this works:**

The construction creates a perpendicular bisector of the segment CD. Since the point B is on the circle the line EF is constructed in such a way that it creates right angles with the radius at point B.  And a line that intersects a circle at only one point and is perpendicular to the radius at that point is by definition a tangent line."
"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","H","Using a protractor create a right triangle where one angle measures 45 degrees and the hypotenuse is 10 cm long; label all sides and angles appropriately.","Here's how to construct a right-angled triangle with a 45° angle and a 10cm hypotenuse using a protractor and ruler:

**1. Draw the Hypotenuse:**

* Use your ruler to draw a line segment that is exactly 10 cm long. This will be the hypotenuse of your triangle.  Label the endpoints A and B.

**2. Create the 45° Angle:**

* Place the center point of your protractor on point A (one end of the hypotenuse).
* Align the protractor's baseline with the hypotenuse AB.
* Find the 45° mark on the protractor.
* Make a small mark at the 45° point.

**3. Draw the Second Side:**

* Remove the protractor.
* Use your ruler to draw a line from point A through the 45° mark you made. Extend this line until it intersects the line segment AB.

**4. Create the Right Angle:**

* This is where the right angle needs to be but there are two possible positions. If your 45° angle is already adjacent to the hypotenuse proceed to step 5. Otherwise:
* You now have a 45° angle at A and you need a right angle (90°).  The easiest method uses the other angle. Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180° and you have one 45° angle and one 90° angle already accounted for the third angle must also be 45°. Using your protractor at point B measure and mark a 45° angle along the extension of the line already created so it ends up creating a 90° angle with the Hypotenuse (a right angle).

**5. Complete the Triangle:**

* From the point where the line you drew in step 3 intersects the hypotenuse (let's call this point C) draw a line perpendicular to the hypotenuse (a 90-degree angle) using the ruler and the protractor (at point C). If you had to use the method in Step 4 to create the right angle simply extend the line at Point C to create the remaining side of the triangle. The line will meet at point B.

**6. Label the Triangle:**

* Label the right angle (90°) at point C.
* Label the 45° angle at point A.
* The remaining angle at point B will also be 45°.
* Measure the lengths of AC and BC using your ruler.  Since it's a 45-45-90 triangle AC and BC should be equal in length and approximately 7.07 cm (this is 10cm / √2).

**Important Note:**  Due to the limitations of drawing with a protractor and ruler your measurements might not be perfectly precise.  The lengths of AC and BC will be approximate but they should be equal and close to 7.07 cm.

1. **Quadrilateral with zero right angles:**  Draw a shape that has no square corners.  A simple example is a parallelogram that isn't a rectangle (meaning its angles are not all 90 degrees). You can also draw an irregular quadrilateral with all angles different from 90 degrees.  Label it clearly as a ""Parallelogram"" or ""Irregular Quadrilateral"".

**Step 1: Find the area of the rectangular garden.**

* The formula for the area of a rectangle is: Area = length × width

**1. Area of the Rectangle:**

* The area of a rectangle is calculated as length × width.
* Length = 10 meters
* Width = 5 meters
* Area of rectangle = 10 meters * 5 meters = 50 square meters

**2. Area of the Semicircle:**

* The area of a circle is calculated as πr² where 'r' is the radius.
* The diameter of the semicircle is 4 meters so the radius is 4 meters / 2 = 2 meters.
* The area of a full circle would be π * (2 meters)² = 4π square meters.
* Since it's a semicircle its area is half of the full circle's area: (4π square meters) / 2 = 2π square meters.

**3. Total Area:**

* Add the area of the rectangle and the area of the semicircle: 50 square meters + 2π square meters.

**1. Understand the properties:**

* **Rectangle:** A quadrilateral with four right angles (90-degree angles). Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
* **Square:** A special type of rectangle. It has four right angles and *all four sides are equal in length*.
* **Trapezoid (or Trapezium):** A quadrilateral with *at least one pair* of parallel sides.  These parallel sides are called bases. The other two sides are not necessarily parallel or equal in length.


**2. Choose a quadrilateral type:**

Decide which type of quadrilateral you want to draw: rectangle square or trapezoid.

**3. Draw the quadrilateral:**

Use a ruler and pencil to draw the chosen quadrilateral accurately.  Pay attention to the angles and side lengths to reflect its properties.

* **Rectangle:** Draw two parallel lines of equal length. Then draw two more parallel lines of equal length perpendicular to the first two completing the rectangle.  Make sure all corners are 90 degrees using a corner of a ruler or a right angle template.

* **Square:**  Draw a line.  From each end of the line draw another line of the same length perpendicular to the first line. Connect the ends of the second two lines to complete the square. All four angles *must* be 90 degrees and all four sides *must* be the same length.

* **Trapezoid:** Draw two parallel lines (bases) of unequal lengths. Then connect the ends of the parallel lines with two non-parallel lines.


**4. Label the quadrilateral:**

Once you have drawn the quadrilateral write its name (rectangle square or trapezoid) clearly next to the diagram.  If you want to be more precise you can also label the parallel sides (for trapezoids) or state the length of sides if they are relevant to defining the shape.

**Example:**

Let's say you choose to draw a rectangle:

1. Draw two parallel lines 5cm long.
2. Draw two more parallel lines 3cm long perpendicular to the first two.
3. Connect the ends to form the rectangle.
4. Write ""Rectangle"" next to the diagram.

A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with *at least one pair of parallel sides*.  We can't directly determine parallelism from angles alone. However we can use the fact that **consecutive interior angles on parallel lines are supplementary** (they add up to 180°).

Let's analyze the given angles:

* **Pair 1:** 70° + 110° = 180°
* **Pair 2:** 110° + 70° = 180°

Since we have two pairs of consecutive angles that are supplementary this implies that the sides between those angles are parallel.  In other words if we label the angles A B C and D in order then angles A and B being supplementary means side AB is parallel to side CD (or vice-versa depending on order).  Angles B and C being supplementary confirms this parallelism.

Therefore the quadrilateral is an **isosceles trapezoid**.  It has one pair of parallel sides and the angles between the parallel sides are equal."

* **Side faces:** These are both rectangles with width 3 cm and height 5 cm. The area of each is 3 cm * 5 cm = 15 cm². Since there are two their combined area is 2 * 15 cm² = 30 cm².

2. **Add the areas of all faces:**

Total surface area = 24 cm² + 40 cm² + 30 cm² = 94 cm²

Therefore the surface area of the rectangular prism is $\boxed{94 cm^2}$."

"Space and form","Properties and relationships of figures and solids","G","Determine the total surface area of a cylinder that has a radius of 6 inches and a height of 10 inches including the areas of both circular bases.","The surface area of a cylinder is composed of three parts:  the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area (the curved part).  Here's how to calculate each and then find the total:

**1. Area of the Circular Bases:**

* A cylinder has two circular bases.
* The area of one circle is πr² where 'r' is the radius.
* Since the radius is 6 inches the area of one base is π * (6 inches)² = 36π square inches.
* The area of *both* bases is 2 * 36π = 72π square inches.

**2. Lateral Surface Area:**

* Imagine cutting the curved side of the cylinder vertically and unrolling it into a rectangle.
* The rectangle's width is the height of the cylinder (10 inches).
* The rectangle's length is the circumference of the circular base (2πr = 2π * 6 inches = 12π inches).
* The area of the rectangle (and thus the lateral surface area) is width * length = 10 inches * 12π inches = 120π square inches.

**3. Total Surface Area:**

* To find the total surface area add the area of the two bases and the lateral surface area:
* Total Surface Area = Area of bases + Lateral Surface Area = 72π + 120π = 192π square inches.

**4. Numerical Approximation:**

*  To get a numerical answer use an approximation for π (approximately 3.14159):
* Total Surface Area ≈ 192 * 3.14159 ≈ 603.18568 square inches.

Therefore the total surface area of the cylinder is approximately 603.19 square inches.  Remember to specify the units (square inches) in your final answer."

This means the ratio of corresponding sides is constant.

We know that:

* ∠A = ∠A (They share the same angle)
* AB/AD = AC/AE = BC/DE

We're given AB = 6 cm and DE = 9 cm.  The ratio of AB to DE is 6/9 = 2/3.  This means that every side in triangle ABC is 2/3 the length of the corresponding side in triangle ADE.

Therefore to find AC we use the proportion:

AB/DE = AC/AE

We know AB/DE = 2/3.  We don't know AE but we can solve for AC in terms of AE:

(2/3) = AC/AE

AC = (2/3)AE

**We cannot find a numerical value for AC without knowing the length of AE (or AD).**  The problem is incomplete as it only provides the length of one side in each triangle and the fact that the angles are equal. We need at least one more corresponding side length to solve for AC."

Here's how you can do it depending on your method:

**Method 1: Using tracing paper (best for accuracy):**

1. **Place tracing paper:** Lay a sheet of tracing paper over the left wing and the center line of the butterfly.
2. **Trace the left wing:** Carefully trace the outline of the left wing onto the tracing paper.  Try to be as precise as possible.
3. **Flip and align:** Flip the tracing paper over so the traced wing is now on the opposite side of the center line.  Align the center line on the tracing paper with the center line on the drawing.
4. **Trace again:** Trace the outline of the mirrored wing onto the drawing paper.
5. **Refine:**  Compare the two wings and make any necessary adjustments to ensure they are perfectly symmetrical.  You might need to refine details like vein patterns or spots.


**Method 2: Using a ruler and pencil (good for learning spatial reasoning):**

1. **Identify key points:** On the left wing identify several key points – the wingtip the leading edge's highest point the lowest point of the wing's curve etc.
2. **Measure distances:**  For each key point on the left wing measure its perpendicular distance to the center line.
3. **Plot mirrored points:** On the right side of the center line mark a point at the same perpendicular distance from the center line as its corresponding point on the left.
4. **Connect the points:** Connect the mirrored points to create the outline of the right wing.  Pay attention to the curves and angles.
5. **Refine:**  Once you have the basic outline refine the details to match the left wing as closely as possible.


**Method 3: Using digital tools (if you have a digital image):**

Many image editing programs (like Photoshop GIMP or even simpler online editors) have mirroring or reflection tools.  You would simply select the left wing use the reflection tool and flip it across the center line. This is often the quickest and easiest method for digital artwork.

**Regardless of the method you choose remember these key points:**

* **Accuracy is key:**  The more accurately you mirror the left wing the more symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing your butterfly will be.
* **Pay attention to detail:** Don't just focus on the overall shape.  Make sure that details like patterns veins and any markings are accurately mirrored.
* **Take your time:**  Symmetry takes patience and precision. Don't rush the process.

1. **Identify the Line of Symmetry:**  Make sure you have a clearly defined vertical line running exactly down the center of the existing half-heart. This is your mirror.

2. **Measure Distances:**  For each point on the existing half-heart measure its perpendicular distance (the shortest distance) to the line of symmetry.

3. **Mirror the Points:** On the opposite side of the line of symmetry mark a point at the same perpendicular distance you measured in step 2.  Make sure this new point is exactly the same distance from the line as the original point.

4. **Connect the Points:** Once you've mirrored several key points along the curve of the half-heart (the more points the smoother the final curve will be) connect these mirrored points to create the other half of the heart.  Use a smooth flowing curve to match the shape of the original half.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine folding the paper along the vertical line. The missing half of the heart should perfectly overlap the drawn half.  Your drawing should make that happen.  Use a ruler to help ensure accuracy especially with distances."

This means that if you draw a line from any point on the star through the center an identical point will exist on the opposite side of the center the same distance away.

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Center:** Find the exact center of the existing star points.  You can do this visually by estimating or for better accuracy by drawing lines connecting opposite points – the intersection of these lines will be the center.

2. **Identify Existing Points and Their ""Partners"":**  Look at each point you already have. For each of those imagine a line drawn from that point through the center.

3. **Add Missing Points:**  Extend the line you imagined in step 2 going the same distance *beyond* the center as the original point is *before* the center.  This is where you add a new point creating a symmetrical pair.  Do this for every existing point that lacks a counterpart.


**Example:**

Let's say you have points A B and C of a star. The center is O.

* You have point A. Draw a line from A through O. Extend that line past O to a point A' that is the same distance from O as A is.  A' is your new point.
* Repeat for points B and C creating points B' and C' respectively.

"Space and form","Symmetries and illustrations","D","Create a tessellation using at least three different congruent shapes and color each shape differently to enhance your design.","Creating a tessellation with at least three different congruent shapes requires a multi-step process. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this task:

**1. Understanding Tessellations:**

A tessellation is a pattern of shapes that covers a surface completely without any overlaps or gaps.  Think of tiling a floor – there are no spaces between the tiles.  For this task your shapes must be *congruent* meaning they are identical in size and shape.

**2. Choosing Your Shapes:**

The easiest way to start is with a shape that already tessellates easily on its own such as:

* **Squares:** These are the simplest and most obvious choice.
* **Equilateral triangles:** Six of these fit around a point.
* **Regular hexagons:** Three of these fit around a point.

However you need *at least three different congruent shapes*. You can't just use three squares; they have to be *different arrangements or combinations* of the same basic shape.   Here are some strategies:

* **Cutting and rearranging:**  Start with a square.  Cut it into smaller congruent shapes (e.g. two congruent triangles or four congruent smaller squares).  Then use these smaller shapes to arrange along with the original shape or each other.
* **Combining shapes:** Use one simple shape as a base (like a square) and combine two or three of those to create a larger shape. This new larger shape is one of your three.

**Example Strategy (using squares):**

1. **Base Shape:** Start with a unit square (Shape A).
2. **Shape B:** Combine two unit squares to create a rectangle (twice the length of the unit square).
3. **Shape C:**  Combine four unit squares into a larger square (double the side length of the unit square).


**3. Arranging the Shapes:**

This is the most challenging part. You need to carefully arrange your three chosen congruent shapes to ensure they fit together without gaps or overlaps.  Experimentation is key!

* **Start small:** Begin by arranging a few of each shape in a small area. Try different combinations and orientations.
* **Focus on points:**  Pay close attention to how the shapes meet at corners (vertices).  The angles of the shapes must add up to 360 degrees around each point.
* **Use graph paper:** Graph paper can be very helpful to ensure accurate placement and to visualize the pattern as it develops.
* **Symmetry:**  Consider using symmetry to create a more balanced and aesthetically pleasing design.


**4. Coloring:**

Once you have a successful tessellation choose three distinct colors to color each of your congruent shapes. This will enhance the visual appeal of your pattern.


**5. Drawing/Creating your Tessellation:**

You can draw your tessellation by hand using a ruler and compass for precision or using digital drawing software.


**Example using Equilateral Triangles:**

1. **Shape A:** A single equilateral triangle.
2. **Shape B:** Two equilateral triangles joined together to form a rhombus.
3. **Shape C:** Three equilateral triangles joined together to form a trapezoid.


By strategically arranging shapes A B and C you can create a tessellation. Remember that the angles at each vertex must add up to 360 degrees.


Remember to be patient and persistent!  Creating a tessellation takes time and experimentation. Don't be discouraged if your first attempts don't work – keep trying different combinations until you find a successful pattern."
"Space and form","Symmetries and illustrations","D","Design a floor plan for a room using congruent hexagonal tiles ensuring that the entire floor is covered without any gaps or overlaps.","You can't perfectly cover a rectangular floor with only congruent regular hexagons *without cutting any tiles*.  This is because the angles of a regular hexagon (120°) don't divide evenly into 360° (the angle around a single point).  You'll always have gaps or overlaps unless you allow for some irregularity in the tile arrangement at the edges or use differently shaped tiles along the edges.

However you *can* come very close to covering a rectangular area and the larger the area the less noticeable the imperfections will be. Here's how you'd approach the design:

1. **Choose your hexagon size:** Decide on the size of your hexagonal tiles. This will determine the overall dimensions of your room.

2. **Lay out a grid:** Start by laying out a grid of hexagons.  The most efficient way to do this is to arrange them in a honeycomb pattern. You'll find that you'll naturally create rows that are offset from each other.

3. **Determine your room dimensions:**  Based on your hexagon size and the grid determine the approximate rectangular dimensions your room will have. The dimensions will be defined by the number of hexagons along the length and width of your grid.  It's important to note that these dimensions will likely *not* be perfectly rectangular; the edges will be slightly jagged.

4. **Addressing the edges:** The challenge comes at the edges.  You'll likely need to cut some hexagonal tiles to fit the rectangular boundary.  There are a few strategies here:

    * **Cut tiles at the edges:** This is the most common solution. You simply cut the hexagons to fit the boundary. The cuts will create irregular shapes.
    * **Add a border of different shapes:**  Instead of cutting hexagons use different shapes (triangles or trapezoids for example) to fill the gaps along the edges.  This creates a visually interesting border.
    * **Accept an irregular room shape:** Design the room so its boundaries accommodate the natural shape created by the hexagonal grid. This means the room itself won't be strictly rectangular. This is probably the cleanest mathematical solution.


5. **Draw the floor plan:** Once you've decided on your method for handling the edges draw the floor plan. You can use graph paper to help with precise placement of the hexagons.  For a neat illustration you can use digital drawing software.

**In summary:** While perfect coverage is impossible you can create a very pleasing and efficient floor plan using congruent hexagons by carefully planning the layout and managing the edge pieces.  The larger your room the less prominent the edge imperfections will be."

Here's a breakdown of how to approach this task:

**1. Understanding Tessellations:**

A tessellation is a pattern of shapes that covers a surface without overlaps or gaps.  Squares tessellate perfectly on their own but triangles require careful arrangement.  The key is finding combinations of squares and triangles that fit seamlessly together.

**2. Basic Building Blocks:**

* **The Square:**  This is your easiest shape.  It's a perfect building block.
* **The Right-Angled Isosceles Triangle:** This triangle (with two equal sides and a right angle) is particularly useful because two of them can fit together to form a square. This makes it easy to integrate with squares in your design.
* **Other Triangles:**  Other triangles *can* work but they will require more planning and potentially more complex patterns to avoid gaps.  Start with the easier isosceles right triangle.

**3. Design Strategies:**

* **Start Simple:** Don't jump into a complex design immediately. Begin with a small section perhaps a repeating unit using squares and your chosen triangles. This unit will be your building block for the larger mural.
* **Grid Approach:**  Consider using a square grid as your base. You can then subdivide some squares using diagonals to create triangles filling in the gaps accordingly.
* **Alternating Patterns:**  Think about alternating patterns of squares and triangles.  A simple one might involve a row of squares followed by a row where each square is cut diagonally into two triangles then back to squares and so on.
* **Rotating Shapes:** Rotating your triangles 90 degrees can help fit them into various spaces in the grid.
* **Symmetry:** Use symmetry to create a balanced and visually appealing design.  Think about mirroring your patterns across axes.
* **Sketching & Experimentation:**  Sketch out your ideas on smaller pieces of paper first.  This is crucial to experimenting with different arrangements and refining your pattern before committing to the large mural.  Don't be afraid to erase and try again.

**4.  Creating the Mural:**

* **Large Paper:**  Use a very large roll of paper or tape together several large sheets to create your mural surface.
* **Pencil Sketch:**  Lightly pencil in your chosen tessellation pattern onto the large paper.  Make sure it extends across the entire surface you're working with.
* **Pen/Marker:**  Once you're satisfied with your pencil sketch carefully trace over it with a pen or marker.
* **Color/Design:**  Add color texture and detail to your design. You can use different colors for squares and triangles to enhance the pattern.


**Example Simple Pattern:**

Imagine a grid of 2x2 squares. Now draw a diagonal line across each of those 2x2 squares dividing each square into two right-angled isosceles triangles. This creates a tessellation using only squares (implicitly as the base) and triangles.  This is just a start; you can create far more complex variations by modifying this basic unit.


Remember the key is to experiment and iterate. Don't be afraid to make mistakes—they're part of the learning process!  Start with a small section perfect it and then repeat that pattern to fill your mural."

2. **Lines through midpoints of opposite sides:** A regular hexagon also has three pairs of opposite sides.  Draw a line connecting the midpoints of each pair of opposite sides. Each of these lines is also a line of symmetry.  These lines are perpendicular bisectors of the sides.

Therefore you'll have drawn a total of six lines of symmetry: three connecting opposite vertices and three connecting midpoints of opposite sides.  These six lines all intersect at the center of the hexagon."

1. **Draw a regular pentagon:** Make sure all five sides are equal in length and all five angles are equal.

2. **Identify the vertices:** Label the vertices (corners) of the pentagon for example A B C D and E.

3. **Lines of symmetry through vertices:** Draw a line from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  You'll find that each of these five lines divides the pentagon into two mirror-image halves. These are lines of symmetry.

4. **Illustrate on a diagram:**  Your diagram should show the pentagon and all five lines of symmetry clearly drawn. Each line should pass through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side.


**Diagram Illustration (can't actually *draw* here but I'll describe it):**

* **Line 3:** From vertex C to the midpoint of side EA.
* **Line 4:** From vertex D to the midpoint of side AB.

**1. Understanding the Octagon and its Symmetry:**

* **Regular Octagon:** A regular octagon has eight equal sides and eight equal angles (each 135°).  This perfect symmetry is key.
* **Lines of Symmetry:**  A line of symmetry divides a shape into two identical halves. A regular octagon has eight lines of symmetry:
    * **Four lines of symmetry connecting opposite vertices (corners):** These run through the center of the octagon.
    * **Four lines of symmetry connecting the midpoints of opposite sides:** These also pass through the center.

**2. Creating the Colorful Design:**

* **Choose your medium:** You can use any medium you like – colored pencils paint digital art software construction paper etc.
* **Start with the octagon:** Draw a precise regular octagon.  You can use a ruler compass or even a template. Accuracy is important for highlighting the symmetry.
* **Add color creatively:**  This is where your artistic freedom comes in.  Consider these ideas:
    * **Radial symmetry:** Use colors that radiate from the center perhaps using a gradient or distinct color sections.
    * **Alternating colors:** Color alternate sides or triangles formed by connecting vertices.
    * **Patterns:** Create repeating patterns within the octagon using your colors.
    * **Geometric shapes:** Add smaller geometric shapes inside the octagon using color to emphasize the symmetry.
    * **Textures:** Experiment with different textures within the color sections to add visual interest.

**3. Labeling the Lines of Symmetry:**

* **Identify all eight:**  Once your design is complete carefully draw and label each of the eight lines of symmetry. Use a ruler to make them straight and clear.
* **Labeling method:** You can label them with numbers (1-8) letters (A-H) or even short descriptions (e.g. ""Vertex Symmetry"" ""Midpoint Symmetry"").  Keep your labeling neat and easy to understand.

4. **Add details:** Use brushes and other tools to add textures or patterns.
5. **Draw lines of symmetry:** Use a line tool and ruler to draw the eight lines of symmetry extending them beyond the octagon for clarity.
6. **Label lines of symmetry:** Use the text tool to label each line.

**Example Workflow (using paper and colored pencils):**

1. **Draw the octagon:** Use a compass and ruler to accurately draw the octagon onto your paper.
2. **Color sections:** Use colored pencils to color in different sections creating your pattern.
3. **Draw lines:** Use a ruler and pencil to draw the eight lines of symmetry lightly at first.  Once satisfied darken them.

1. **Line up paperclips:** Place paperclips end-to-end along the length of your desk starting at one edge.  Make sure they are touching each other and in a straight line.

2. **Count the paperclips:** As you lay down each paperclip count it. Keep track of the total number.

3. **Record the measurement:** Once you've reached the other edge of the desk (or as close as you can get) note down the total number of paperclips.  This is your measurement.  For example you might write: ""My desk is 27 paperclips long.""


**Important Considerations:**

* **Uniform Paperclips:**  Ideally use paperclips of the same size and type.  Different sizes will give you inaccurate results.
* **Straight Line:**  Keep the paperclips in a straight line along the longest edge of your desk.
* **Units:**  Your measurement is in ""paperclips.""

"Sizes and measurement","Measuring and calculating","B","How many paper clips long is your favorite book? Use paper clips to measure it and count them carefully.","To solve this task follow these steps:

1. **Gather materials:** You'll need your favorite book and a supply of identical paper clips.  Using paper clips of different sizes will make your measurement inaccurate.

2. **Choose a measurement unit:** Decide whether you'll measure the length of the book using the length of a single paper clip or the total length of several paper clips laid end-to-end.  Using a single paper clip's length is generally more accurate but it will take longer.  However it's likely easier to work with a few paperclips laid end to end and then multiplying the count by the number of clips in each set.

3. **Measure the length:** Carefully lay paper clips along the longest edge of your book (typically the spine).  Make sure the paper clips are placed end-to-end with minimal gaps or overlaps.

4. **Count the paper clips:**  Once you've laid out the paper clips along the entire length of the book count how many you used.  This number is the length of your book in paper clips.

2. **Zero the scale:** If your balance scale has a mechanism to zero it out (to account for any slight imbalances in the scale itself) do so.  This ensures an accurate reading.

3. **Weigh the book:** Place the book on one side of the balance scale.

4. **Weigh the pencil case:** Place the pencil case on the *other* side of the balance scale.

The result is the difference in weight.  For example if the book weighs 1.5 kg and the pencil case weighs 0.2 kg the book is heavier by 1.3 kg (1.5 kg - 0.2 kg = 1.3 kg).

    * **If your scale doesn't show measurements:** You'll need additional weights (if your balance scale has them) to find the difference. Add weights to the lighter side until the scale balances. The total weight of the added weights represents the difference in weight between the book and the pencil case.  Alternatively if you don't have additional weights you can use a less precise method of estimating the difference based on how much the scale tips.

7. **Record your results:** Write down the weight of the book the weight of the pencil case and which object is heavier by how much.  For example: ""The book weighs X grams/kilograms the pencil case weighs Y grams/kilograms. The book is heavier than the pencil case by Z grams/kilograms.""  Replace X Y and Z with your actual measurements.


Remember to use consistent units (grams or kilograms) throughout your measurements and calculations."
"Sizes and measurement","Recording and comparing quantities","C","Using a balance scale compare the weight of a bag of oranges to a bag of apples and explain which bag has more weight.","To compare the weight of the bag of oranges and the bag of apples using a balance scale follow these steps:

1. **Place the bag of oranges on one side of the balance scale.**
2. **Place the bag of apples on the other side of the balance scale.**

Now observe:

* **If the scale balances** the bags weigh the same.
* **If the side with the oranges goes down** the bag of oranges is heavier.
* **If the side with the apples goes down** the bag of apples is heavier.

Therefore the bag that causes its side of the scale to go down is the heavier bag.  You can then state your conclusion: ""The bag of [oranges/apples] weighs more than the bag of [apples/oranges]."""

The problem is a simple subtraction problem.

To find out how many more grams the robot weighs than the car subtract the weight of the car from the weight of the robot:

"Sizes and measurement","Calculating quantities","E","A rectangular garden measures 10 meters by 5 meters and there is a path of 1 meter wide that surrounds the garden; calculate the total perimeter of the garden including the path.","There are two ways to solve this:

**Method 1:  Find the dimensions of the larger rectangle and calculate the perimeter.**

1. **Find the new length:** The garden's length is 10 meters.  The path adds 1 meter to each side so the total length including the path is 10m + 1m + 1m = 12m.

2. **Find the new width:** The garden's width is 5 meters. The path adds 1 meter to each side so the total width including the path is 5m + 1m + 1m = 7m.

3. **Calculate the perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).  Therefore the perimeter of the garden including the path is 2 * (12m + 7m) = 2 * 19m = 38m.


**Method 2: Calculate the perimeter of the garden and the path separately and add them**

1. **Calculate the garden's perimeter:** The garden's perimeter is 2 * (10m + 5m) = 30m

2. **Calculate the path's perimeter (a bit trickier):**  The path adds four rectangles to the sides of the garden (two longer ones and two shorter ones) plus four corner squares.  

    * Two longer rectangles: 2 * (10m * 1m) = 20m
    * Two shorter rectangles: 2 * (5m * 1m) = 10m
    * Four corner squares: 4 * (1m * 1m) = 4m^2  (These are squares with sides of 1 meter each. Note the area of the squares are calculated here but it is still counted as a path perimeter because we are adding it to the perimeter length).
    * Total path perimeter = 20m + 10m + 4m = 34m

3. **Add the perimeters:** 30m (garden) + 34m (path) = 64m. This method has a slight issue because we are counting corner squares twice.  This leads to an incorrect result. It is generally much simpler to calculate by the first method.

**Therefore the correct total perimeter of the garden including the path is 38 meters.**  Method 1 is the more straightforward and reliable approach for this problem."
"Sizes and measurement","Calculating quantities","E","A square patio with sides of 4 feet is adjacent to a rectangular area measuring 6 feet by 3 feet; find the perimeter of the combined shape.","The key to solving this is understanding that the perimeter is the total distance around the outside of the combined shape.  Because the square and rectangle are adjacent (sharing a side) that shared side isn't part of the *combined* shape's perimeter.

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

1. **Perimeter of the square:** A square has four equal sides. The perimeter of the 4-foot square is 4 sides * 4 feet/side = 16 feet.

2. **Perimeter of the rectangle:** A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. The perimeter of the 6-foot by 3-foot rectangle is (2 * 6 feet) + (2 * 3 feet) = 12 feet + 6 feet = 18 feet.

3. **Shared side:** The square and rectangle share a 4-foot side.  This shared side is counted twice in the individual perimeters (once for the square and once for the rectangle) but it's only part of the outer perimeter *once*.

4. **Combined perimeter:** To find the perimeter of the combined shape add the perimeters of the square and rectangle and then subtract the length of the shared side *twice* (because it's been counted twice).

   Combined perimeter = (Perimeter of square) + (Perimeter of rectangle) - (2 * length of shared side)
   Combined perimeter = 16 feet + 18 feet - (2 * 4 feet)
   Combined perimeter = 34 feet - 8 feet
   Combined perimeter = 26 feet


Therefore the perimeter of the combined shape is $\boxed{26}$ feet."

To find the perimeter of the fenced area you need to determine the dimensions of this larger rectangle.

1. **Find the length of the larger rectangle:** The pool is 8 meters long and the fence extends 2 meters on each side.  Therefore the length of the larger rectangle is 8m + 2m + 2m = 12m.

2. **Find the width of the larger rectangle:** The pool is 4 meters wide and the fence extends 2 meters on each side. Therefore the width of the larger rectangle is 4m + 2m + 2m = 8m.

3. **Calculate the perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is found using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).  In this case:

   Perimeter = 2 * (12m + 8m) = 2 * 20m = 40m

Therefore the perimeter of the fenced area is $\boxed{40 \text{ meters}}$."

2. **Calculate the radius squared:** 3² = 9 square feet

3. **Multiply the results:** V = π * 9 square feet * 10 feet = 90π cubic feet

4. **Use the approximation of π:** V ≈ 90 * 3.14159 cubic feet

5. **Calculate the final volume:** V ≈ 282.7431 cubic feet

Where:

* **π (pi)** is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159
* **radius** is the distance from the center of the circle to its edge (given as 5 meters).

**1. Calculate the circumference in meters:**

Substitute the given radius into the formula:

Circumference = 2 * π * 5 meters  ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 5 meters ≈ 31.4159 meters

Therefore the circumference of the garden is approximately 31.42 meters (rounding to two decimal places).


**2. Convert the circumference to centimeters:**

Since there are 100 centimeters in 1 meter multiply the circumference in meters by 100:

Circumference in centimeters = 31.4159 meters * 100 centimeters/meter ≈ 3141.59 centimeters

Therefore the circumference of the garden is approximately 3141.59 centimeters.


In summary:

* **Circumference in meters:** Approximately 31.42 meters

* **Calculation:** Substitute the diameter into the formula: C = π * 10 feet  ≈ 31.4159 feet (using π ≈ 3.14159)

**2. Convert Feet to Inches:**

* **Conversion Factor:** There are 12 inches in 1 foot.
* **Calculation:** Multiply the circumference in feet by the conversion factor: 31.4159 feet * 12 inches/foot ≈ 376.99 inches

**Therefore the circumference of the swimming pool is approximately 377 inches.**  We round to a reasonable number of significant figures based on the precision of the given diameter."

**1. Calculate the circumference:**

Circumference = 2 * 3.14159 * 14 inches 
Circumference ≈ 87.96452 inches

**2. Round to the nearest inch:**

Since the question asks for the answer rounded to the nearest inch we look at the tenths place (the 9).  Since it's 5 or greater we round up.

"Sizes and measurement","Recording and comparing quantities","H","A group of students recorded the heights of plants in centimeters after three weeks of growth: 15 22 18 25 and 20; calculate the average height and determine how much each height differs from the average.","Here's how to solve this task step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the average height:**

* **Sum the heights:** 15 + 22 + 18 + 25 + 20 = 100 cm
* **Divide by the number of plants:** 100 cm / 5 plants = 20 cm

The average height of the plants is 20 cm.

**2. Determine the difference of each height from the average:**

For each plant height subtract the average height (20 cm) from the individual plant height.  This will give you a positive number if the plant is taller than average and a negative number if it's shorter.

* **Plant 1 (15 cm):** 15 cm - 20 cm = -5 cm
* **Plant 2 (22 cm):** 22 cm - 20 cm = +2 cm
* **Plant 3 (18 cm):** 18 cm - 20 cm = -2 cm
* **Plant 4 (25 cm):** 25 cm - 20 cm = +5 cm
* **Plant 5 (20 cm):** 20 cm - 20 cm = 0 cm

**Therefore:**

* The average height of the plants is 20 cm.
* The differences from the average are: -5 cm +2 cm -2 cm +5 cm and 0 cm.  This shows how much each plant's height deviates from the average."

1. **Order the data:** Arrange the water usage values in ascending order: 150 180 210.

2. **Identify the middle value:** Since there are three values (an odd number) the median is the middle value.  In this case the median is 180 liters.

**What the median reveals:**

The median water usage of 180 liters represents the typical or central tendency of water consumption in these three households.  It means that one household uses less than 180 liters and one uses more with 180 liters being the ""middle ground.""  The median provides a more robust measure of central tendency than the mean (average) in cases where there might be outliers or skewed data.  In this small dataset it gives a reasonable indication of a typical monthly water consumption.

1. **Find a ruler:**  Make sure you have a ruler that measures in inches.

2. **Measure the ruler:** Note the length of your ruler in inches.  Let's say for example your ruler is 12 inches long.

3. **Compare the ruler to your desk:**  Place the ruler along the edge of your desk. Visually estimate how many times the ruler's length fits across the width of your desk.  For example you might see that the ruler fits approximately 2 and a half times across your desk.

4. **Calculate the estimate:** Multiply the ruler's length by your visual estimate. In our example: 12 inches/ruler * 2.5 rulers = 30 inches.  Therefore your estimated desk width is 30 inches.

5. **Refine the estimate (optional):**  If you want a more precise estimate you can measure a portion of the desk width with the ruler and then extrapolate that measurement to the full width.  For example you could measure a section of your desk width say 4 inches and then see how many times that 4-inch section repeats across the whole width.

6. **Draw a sketch:** Draw a quick rectangle representing your desk.  Label the width with your estimated measurement (e.g. ""30 inches"").

This is based on Archimedes' principle: an object submerged in a fluid displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume.

Therefore to calculate the volume of the toy figurine simply subtract the initial water level from the final water level:

Volume of figurine = Final water level - Initial water level = 315 mL - 200 mL = 115 mL

The volume of the toy figurine is $\boxed{115 mL}$."

To calculate the surface area you need to find the area of each face and then add them all together.

Here's how to do it:

1. **Find the area of each face:** A rectangular prism has three pairs of identical faces.

   * **Pair 1 (Length x Width):**  5 cm * 3 cm = 15 cm² (There are two of these faces)
   * **Pair 2 (Length x Height):** 5 cm * 4 cm = 20 cm² (There are two of these faces)
   * **Pair 3 (Width x Height):** 3 cm * 4 cm = 12 cm² (There are two of these faces)

2. **Calculate the total surface area:** Add the areas of all six faces together.

   * Total Surface Area = (2 * 15 cm²) + (2 * 20 cm²) + (2 * 12 cm²) = 30 cm² + 40 cm² + 24 cm² = 94 cm²

Therefore the surface area of the rectangular prism is $\boxed{94 cm²}$."

**1. Area of the top and bottom:**

* Both the top and bottom are circles.
* The area of a circle is given by the formula: A = πr² where 'r' is the radius.
* Since the radius (r) is 3 cm the area of one circle is π * (3 cm)² = 9π cm².
* Since there are two circles (top and bottom) their combined area is 2 * 9π cm² = 18π cm².

**2. Area of the curved side:**

* Imagine unrolling the curved side of the cylinder to form a rectangle.
* The width of this rectangle is the height of the cylinder (10 cm).
* The length of this rectangle is the circumference of the circular base.  The circumference of a circle is given by the formula: C = 2πr.
* With a radius of 3 cm the circumference is 2π * 3 cm = 6π cm.
* Therefore the area of the curved side is width * length = 10 cm * 6π cm = 60π cm².

**3. Total Surface Area:**

* Add the area of the top and bottom to the area of the curved side: 18π cm² + 60π cm² = 78π cm².

**4. Calculation and Result:**

* Use the value of π (approximately 3.14159) to get a numerical answer:
* Total Surface Area ≈ 78 * 3.14159 cm² ≈ 245.04 cm²

Therefore the total surface area of the cylindrical container is approximately **245.04 square centimeters**."

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Surface Area of the Cube:**

* A cube has 6 faces each a square.
* The area of one face is side * side = 6 cm * 6 cm = 36 cm²
* The total surface area of the cube is 6 * 36 cm² = 216 cm²

**2. Surface Area of the Hemisphere:**

* The surface area of a sphere is 4πr² where 'r' is the radius.
* A hemisphere is half a sphere so its surface area is (4πr²)/2 = 2πr²
* With a radius of 3 cm the surface area of the hemisphere is 2π(3 cm)² = 18π cm²

**3. Area of the Circular Base of the Hemisphere:**

* This is the area where the hemisphere sits on the cube.  It's a circle with the same radius as the hemisphere.
* The area of a circle is πr²
* The area of the circular base is π(3 cm)² = 9π cm²

**4. Total Surface Area of the Composite Shape:**

* Add the surface area of the cube and the surface area of the hemisphere: 216 cm² + 18π cm²
* Subtract the area of the circular base of the hemisphere (because it's not part of the external surface): 216 cm² + 18π cm² - 9π cm²
* This simplifies to: 216 cm² + 9π cm²

**5. Final Calculation:**

* Use a calculator to compute the final answer:  216 cm² + 9π cm² ≈ 216 cm² + 28.27 cm² ≈ 244.27 cm²

Therefore the surface area of the composite shape is approximately **244.27 cm²**.  Remember to use the appropriate units (cm²) in your final answer."

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Identify the sides:**  The ladder is the hypotenuse (15 feet). The distance from the wall to the base of the ladder is one leg (9 feet).  The height of the wall where the ladder touches is the other leg (this is what we want to find).

2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**  Let's call the height of the wall 'h'.  The theorem can be written as:

   a² + b² = c²

   where:
     * a = the base (9 feet)
     * b = the height (h feet)
     * c = the hypotenuse (15 feet)

The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) works for right-angled triangles.  While a rectangle *has* right angles we only know the length of *one* side (12 meters). We need the length of the *adjacent* side to use the theorem.

Let's call the sides of the rectangle 'a' and 'b' and the diagonal 'c'.  You've given us 'a' = 12 meters.  To find 'c' you also need the value of 'b' (the length of the other side of the rectangle).

**Once you have the length of the other side (b):**

1. **Identify a b and c:**  'a' is 12 meters (the known side).  'b' will be the length of the other side of the rectangle (the information you're missing).  'c' is the diagonal path you want to find.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:** Substitute the values of 'a' and 'b' into the equation a² + b² = c².

3. **Solve for c:**  After substituting perform the calculations to find the value of 'c' which represents the length of the diagonal path.  Remember to take the square root of both sides of the equation at the end to isolate 'c'.

**Example:**

Let's say the other side of the rectangle (b) measures 5 meters. Then:

1. a = 12 meters b = 5 meters c = ?

2. 12² + 5² = c²

3. 144 + 25 = c²

4. 169 = c²

5. c = √169 = 13 meters

Therefore if the other side is 5 meters the diagonal path is 13 meters long.  You need to find the length of the other side of the rectangle to complete the calculation."

1. **Identify the angle:**  You're measuring the inside corner of the desk.  This is the angle formed where two sides of the desk meet.

2. **Place the protractor:**  Position the protractor so that the center point (where the two lines cross on the protractor) is exactly on the corner of the desk.

3. **Align the baseline:** One of the protractor's straight edges (the baseline) should lie exactly along one side of the desk's corner.  It's crucial to get this alignment precise.

4. **Read the measurement:** Look where the other side of the desk's corner intersects the protractor's scale.  Read the degree measurement from that point. Protractors usually have two scales (inner and outer); choose the scale that gives a reasonable answer (most desk corners are close to 90 degrees).

5. **Record the measurement:** Write down the degree measurement.  For example you might record ""88 degrees"" or ""92 degrees"".  Since it's a physical measurement a degree or two of variation is normal.  Don't round to an unnecessarily precise number.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Desk Stability:** Make sure your desk is stable and won't move while you're measuring.
* **Protractor Accuracy:**  The accuracy of your measurement depends on the accuracy of your protractor and how carefully you align it.
* **Obstructions:**  If anything is obstructing your view of the corner move it out of the way.
* **Type of Corner:** Most desks have a 90-degree (right) corner but it's possible it's slightly more or less.

"Sizes and measurement","Measuring and calculating","D","Find an everyday object in your home such as a book or a picture frame and estimate the angle formed at one of its corners then verify your estimation using a protractor.","Here's how to solve this task:

**1. Choose an object:** Select a household item with a corner preferably one that's relatively sharp and clearly defined.  A book picture frame box or even a tile on your floor are good choices.

**2. Estimate the angle:**  Look at the corner you've chosen.  Try to estimate the angle it forms.  Consider these reference points:

* **90° (right angle):** Think of a perfect square or rectangle corner.  This is your baseline.
* **180° (straight angle):** A straight line.
* **45°:** Half of a right angle.
* **Acute angles:** Less than 90°.
* **Obtuse angles:** Greater than 90° but less than 180°.

Based on these references make your best guess of the angle in degrees.  Write down your estimate.  For example ""I estimate the angle of the book's corner to be approximately 85°.""

**3. Measure with a protractor:**  Carefully place the protractor so that its center point aligns with the corner of the object and the baseline of the protractor aligns with one side of the angle.  Read the measurement where the other side of the angle intersects the protractor's scale.

**4. Compare and analyze:** Compare your estimate to the actual measurement from the protractor.  How close was your estimate?  What factors might have led to any discrepancy?  Perhaps the corner wasn't perfectly sharp or your visual estimation skills need a little practice.  Write down your protractor measurement and the difference between your estimate and the measurement.  Reflect on the process – what did you learn about estimating angles?

**Example:**

Let's say you choose a book.

* **Step 2 (Estimate):** You look at the corner and guess it's about 92°.
* **Step 3 (Measurement):** You use a protractor and find the angle is 91°.
* **Step 4 (Comparison):** Your estimate was only 1° off! You might note that the binding of the book made the corner slightly less than a perfect right angle.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

**1. Understanding Clock Angles:**

* A clock face is a circle and a circle contains 360 degrees.
* The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes (6 degrees per minute).
* The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours (30 degrees per hour).

**2. Setting up the Measurements:**

You'll need a clock (or a clock image) and a protractor.  It's best to use a clock with clear markings for the numbers.

**3. Measuring the Angles:**

For each time (3:00 6:00 9:00) follow these steps:

* **3:00:**
    * The hour hand points directly at the 3.
    * The minute hand points directly at the 12.
    * **Angle Measurement:** Place the center point of your protractor on the center of the clock face. Align the 0-degree mark of the protractor with the hour hand (pointing at the 3).  Read the degree measurement where the minute hand (pointing at the 12) intersects the protractor's scale.  This should be a 90-degree angle.

* **6:00:**
    * The hour hand points directly at the 6.
    * The minute hand points directly at the 12.
    * **Angle Measurement:**  Repeat the process from 3:00 this time aligning the protractor's 0-degree mark with the hour hand (at the 6). Measure the angle to the minute hand (at the 12).  This should be a 180-degree angle.

* **9:00:**
    * The hour hand points directly at the 9.
    * The minute hand points directly at the 12.
    * **Angle Measurement:**  Repeat the process aligning the 0-degree mark with the hour hand (at the 9). Measure the angle to the minute hand (at the 12).  This should be a 270-degree angle.  You might need to use the other scale on your protractor to get the reading.


**4. Recording Your Results:**

Record your measurements for each time in a table like this:

| Time   | Angle Measurement (degrees) |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| 3:00   | 90                           |
| 6:00   | 180                          |
| 9:00   | 270                          |


**Important Note:**  Due to the physical limitations of placing a protractor on a clock your measurements might be slightly off (a degree or two).

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","F","Create a line graph to represent the average daily temperatures (in °F) for each month based on the following data: January 30 February 32 March 45 April 58 May 70 June 80 July 85 August 83 September 75 October 60 November 45 December 35.","To create a line graph representing the average daily temperatures you'll need to follow these steps:

**1. Prepare your data:**

* **X-axis (Horizontal):** This will represent the months of the year.  You can abbreviate them (Jan Feb Mar etc.) for clarity.
* **Y-axis (Vertical):** This will represent the average daily temperature in °F.  Determine the range you need –  it should encompass the lowest (30°F) and highest (85°F) temperatures in your data.  You might want to start at 25°F and go up to 90°F in increments of 5°F for easy readability.

**2. Choose a graphing method:**

* **Manual method:** You can draw the graph by hand on graph paper.  Use a ruler to ensure straight lines.
* **Software method:** Use a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel Google Sheets or a dedicated graphing/data visualization tool like LibreOffice Calc Desmos or even a simple online graphing calculator.  These methods are generally preferred for accuracy and ease of creating professional-looking graphs.


**3. Plot the data:**

* **For the manual method:** Locate each month on the X-axis and its corresponding temperature on the Y-axis.  Mark the point where they intersect.  Repeat this for all twelve months.
* **For the software method:**  Most software will allow you to input your data in a table (months in one column temperatures in another). Then select the data and choose the ""line graph"" or ""line chart"" option from the charting tools. The software will automatically plot the points and connect them with lines.

**4. Label and title your graph:**

* **X-axis label:** ""Month""
* **Y-axis label:** ""Average Daily Temperature (°F)""
* **Graph title:**  Something descriptive like ""Average Daily Temperatures Throughout the Year"".

**5. (Optional) Add enhancements:**

* **Grid lines:**  These can make it easier to read the values.
* **Legend:**  Usually unnecessary for a simple line graph with only one data set.
* **Data points:** You might want to visually highlight each data point with a small circle or square on the line.


**Example using Google Sheets:**

1. Open a Google Sheet.
2. In column A list the months (Jan Feb Mar... Dec).
3. In column B list the corresponding temperatures (30 32 45... 35).
4. Select both columns A and B.
5. Go to ""Insert"" > ""Chart"".
6. Google Sheets will automatically suggest a line chart.  You can customize the chart's title axis labels and other features in the ""Chart editor"" that appears on the right.


By following these steps you will successfully create a line graph visualizing the average daily temperatures for each month. Remember to choose a method that suits your skill level and resources."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","F","Using the sales data of a bakery over a week (Monday: 50 cupcakes Tuesday: 70 cupcakes Wednesday: 90 cupcakes Thursday: 40 cupcakes Friday: 120 cupcakes Saturday: 150 cupcakes Sunday: 100 cupcakes) construct a line graph and describe the trend in sales throughout the week.","To solve this task you'll need to create a line graph and then interpret it. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**1. Prepare your data:**

* **X-axis (horizontal):** This represents the days of the week.  Order them chronologically: Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.
* **Y-axis (vertical):** This represents the number of cupcakes sold.  Choose a scale that comfortably fits the highest value (150 cupcakes).  You might start at 0 and go up in increments of 20 (0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160).

**2. Create the line graph:**

* **Plot the points:** For each day find the corresponding number of cupcakes sold on your Y-axis and the day on your X-axis.  Place a point where these two intersect. For example Monday (50 cupcakes) would be a point slightly above the 40 mark on the Y-axis and directly above ""Monday"" on the X-axis.  Repeat for all days.
* **Connect the points:** Draw a line connecting the points you've plotted.  This line visually represents the sales trend over the week.

**3. Describe the trend:**

Once your line graph is complete analyze the line to describe the sales trend.  Look for:

* **Overall direction:** Does the line generally go up down or stay relatively flat?  This indicates whether sales are generally increasing decreasing or remaining consistent.
* **Significant changes:** Are there any days with particularly high or low sales compared to surrounding days? Note these specific days and their sales figures.  What might explain these fluctuations?  (e.g. higher sales on weekends due to increased foot traffic).
* **Patterns:**  Are there any repeating patterns? For example is there a consistent increase toward the weekend and then a drop-off on Sunday?

**Example Trend Description (based on the provided data):**

""The line graph shows a general upward trend in cupcake sales throughout the week. Sales started moderately at 50 cupcakes on Monday gradually increasing throughout the week with peaks on Saturday (150 cupcakes) and Friday (120 cupcakes). There is a noticeable drop on Thursday (40 cupcakes) which is an outlier compared to the otherwise increasing trend.  Sales remain high on Sunday (100 cupcakes) before presumably decreasing again on Monday of the following week.  The data suggests that weekend days significantly boost sales compared to weekdays.""


Remember to clearly label your axes (Day of the Week and Number of Cupcakes Sold) title your graph (e.g. ""Bakery Cupcake Sales - Weekly Trend"") and use a ruler or straight edge for accuracy when drawing the lines and axes. You can do this manually with graph paper or using software such as Excel Google Sheets or online graphing tools."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","F","Draw a line graph to display the number of books read by students in a month: Week 1: 5 books Week 2: 7 books Week 3: 15 books Week 4: 10 books and analyze which week had the highest reading rate.","To solve this task follow these steps:

**1. Prepare your data:**

You already have the data neatly organized.  List it in a table for clarity:

| Week | Number of Books Read |
|---|---|
| Week 1 | 5 |
| Week 2 | 7 |
| Week 3 | 15 |
| Week 4 | 10 |


**2. Create the Line Graph:**

* **Choose your axes:** The horizontal (x-axis) will represent the weeks (Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4). The vertical (y-axis) will represent the number of books read.  Make sure your y-axis scale accommodates the highest number of books (15 in this case).  You might want to start the y-axis at 0 and go up in increments of 2 or 5.

* **Plot the points:** For each week find the corresponding number of books read.  Mark that point on your graph. For example for Week 1 you'll put a point above ""Week 1"" on the x-axis and level with ""5"" on the y-axis.

* **Connect the points:** Draw a line connecting the points in chronological order (Week 1 to Week 2 Week 2 to Week 3 and so on). This line visually represents the trend in the number of books read over the month.


**3. Analyze the Graph and Answer the Question:**

Once you've drawn the line graph simply look at it to determine which week shows the highest point on the line.  This visually represents the highest number of books read. In this case it's **Week 3**.


**To make the graph you can use:**

* **Graph paper:**  This is a classic method for creating accurate graphs by hand.
* **Spreadsheet software (like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets):** These programs allow you to input your data and automatically generate a line graph.  They also offer options for customizing the graph's appearance (titles labels etc.).
* **Online graphing tools:**  Many free online tools are available that let you create graphs easily without needing to install software.  Just search for ""online line graph maker.""


Remember to label your graph clearly with a title (e.g. ""Books Read Per Week"") axis labels (e.g. ""Week"" and ""Number of Books"") and a legend if needed.  A clearly labeled graph makes the analysis much easier."

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","E","In a pie chart depicting the distribution of pets in a neighborhood dogs make up 40% and cats 30%; what proportion of pets do other animals represent if the total pets are 200?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Find the total percentage of dogs and cats:** Dogs (40%) + Cats (30%) = 70%

2. **Find the percentage of other animals:**  Since the pie chart represents the whole (100%) the remaining percentage belongs to other animals: 100% - 70% = 30%

3. **Calculate the number of other animals:**  30% of the total number of pets (200) is (30/100) * 200 = 60

4. **Find the proportion of other animals:** The proportion of other animals is the number of other animals divided by the total number of pets: 60 / 200 = 0.3  or 30%

**Therefore other animals represent 30% of the pets and there are 60 other animals in the neighborhood.**"
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","B","Ask your family members what their favorite fruit is then create a pictograph to show how many people chose each fruit.","Here's how to solve this task step-by-step:

**1. Gather Data:**

* **Ask:** Go to each family member (including yourself!) and ask them ""What is your favorite fruit?""  Write down their responses.  Be sure to include everyone you want to include in your pictograph.
* **Record:**  Keep a simple tally or list. For example:
    * Apple: 3
    * Banana: 2
    * Strawberry: 1
    * Orange: 2


**2. Create the Pictograph:**

* **Choose a Symbol:** Decide on a simple picture to represent one person's favorite fruit.  A small drawing of a fruit (e.g. a small apple for apple choices) would work well.  You could also use a simple symbol like a star or a circle.
* **Title:** Give your pictograph a clear title such as ""Family's Favorite Fruits.""
* **Labels:**
    * **Vertical Axis (Side):** List the names of the different fruits vertically.
    * **Horizontal Axis (Bottom):** Label this as ""Number of People.""  You might add a key explaining what your chosen symbol represents (e.g.  ""1 = 1 person"").
* **Draw the Symbols:** For each fruit draw the number of symbols that corresponds to the number of people who chose that fruit.  For instance if three people chose apples draw three small apple symbols next to ""Apple.""

**3. Example Pictograph:**

Let's use the data from the example above:

**Family's Favorite Fruits**

| Fruit       | Number of People |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Apple       | 🍎🍎🍎             |
| Banana      | 🍌🍌              |
| Strawberry  | 🍓                |
| Orange      | 🍊🍊              |

**Key:**  🍎🍌🍓🍊 = 1 person


**Tips for a Good Pictograph:**

* **Neatness:** Make sure your drawings are neat and easy to understand.  Use a ruler to draw straight lines if needed.
* **Clarity:** Use clear and simple labels.
* **Scale:** If you have a large family you might need to use a different scale (e.g. one symbol could represent 2 people).  This should be clearly stated in the key.
* **Visual Appeal:** Consider adding color to make your pictograph more attractive.

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","B","Survey your classmates about their favorite colors and use a pictograph to display the results with pictures of colored squares.","Here's how to complete this task:

**1. Conduct the Survey:**

* **Ask the question:**  Simply ask each of your classmates ""What is your favorite color?""  Keep it straightforward and simple.
* **Record the responses:**  As they answer keep a tally of how many people chose each color. You can do this using a list or a table.  For example:

| Color       | Tally    | Count |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Red         | IIII     | 4     |
| Blue        | IIIIIII  | 7     |
| Green       | III      | 3     |
| Purple      | II       | 2     |
| Yellow      | I        | 1     |


**2. Create the Pictograph:**

* **Choose a symbol:** You've been told to use colored squares. Decide on a size for your square.  Make sure it's big enough to see easily but small enough to fit reasonably on your page.
* **Create a key:**  This explains what each square represents.  For example:  ""One square = 1 person.""  You might need to adjust this key depending on the number of responses; you could use ""One square = 2 people"" if you have many responses to avoid a very long pictograph.
* **Draw the pictograph:**  Draw a title at the top (e.g. ""Class Favorite Colors""). Then list each color down the side and use the colored squares to represent the number of people who chose that color. For example if seven people chose blue you would draw seven blue squares next to ""Blue"" in your pictograph.
* **Make it visually appealing:** Use colored pencils or crayons to make the squares vibrant and easy to read.  Consider adding a border or some other simple design elements to make it look nicer.

**Example Pictograph:**

**Class Favorite Colors**

| Color       | Count | Pictograph                                   |

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","B","Conduct a survey to find out how many pets your friends have and draw a pictograph to represent the number of pets owned by each friend.","To complete this task you'll follow these steps:

**1. Conduct the Survey:**

* **Identify your friends:**  Make a list of the friends you want to include in your survey.
* **Ask the question:**  Simply ask each friend ""How many pets do you have?""  Be sure to clarify that you mean all types of pets (dogs cats fish birds etc.).
* **Record the data:** Create a table to record each friend's name and the number of pets they own. For example:

| Friend's Name | Number of Pets |
|---|---|
| Alice | 2 |
| Bob | 0 |
| Carol | 1 |
| David | 3 |
| Eve | 1 |


**2. Draw the Pictograph:**

A pictograph uses pictures or symbols to represent data.  Here's how to create one:

* **Choose a symbol:** Select a simple picture to represent one pet.  A small paw print a generic animal silhouette or even a simple circle would work well.
* **Create a key:**  This explains what your symbol represents.  For example:  ""One paw print = 1 pet.""
* **Draw the graph:**
    * **Label the axes:** The left-hand column (vertical axis) lists the names of your friends.  The top row (horizontal axis) will be the number of pets.
    * **Draw symbols:** For each friend draw the appropriate number of symbols next to their name.  If a friend has more than one pet you'll draw multiple symbols.
    * **Title the graph:** Give your pictograph a clear title such as ""Number of Pets Owned by My Friends.""

**Example Pictograph:**

Let's use the data from the table above.  We'll use a paw print as our symbol and the key ""One paw print = 1 pet.""

```
Number of Pets Owned by My Friends

Friend's Name | Number of Pets
------------- | ---------------
Alice         |🐾🐾
Bob           |
Carol         |🐾
David         |🐾🐾🐾
Eve           |🐾
```


**Tips for a good pictograph:**

* **Keep it simple:** Use easy-to-understand symbols.
* **Use a consistent scale:** Each symbol should represent the same quantity throughout the graph.
* **Neatness counts:** Make sure your pictograph is clearly labeled and easy to read.
* **Consider half-symbols:** If you need to represent a half-pet (unlikely but possible!) you can draw a half-symbol.


By following these steps you'll successfully complete the task and create a visual representation of your friends' pet ownership. Remember to be accurate and neat in your work!"

A frequency table simply organizes the data to show how many times each transportation mode appears.  It looks like this:

| Mode of Transportation | Frequency |
|---|---|
| Bus | 8 |
| Car | 10 |
| Bicycle | 4 |
| Walking | 3 |

|---|---|
| 0 | 5 |
| 1 | 8 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 3 |
| **Total** | **20** |


**2. Interpret the Frequency Table and Reading Habits:**

The frequency table indicates the following about the reading habits of the 20 students surveyed:

* **Most students read a low number of books:** The highest frequency is 8 students who read only 1 book last month.  A significant portion (5 out of 20) reported reading zero books.
* **Reading habits are somewhat diverse but skewed towards less reading:** While there's a range of 0 to 3 books read the majority of students fall into the lower end of that range.
* **Few students read extensively:** Only 3 students read 3 books representing a small minority of the surveyed group.

In summary the data suggests that among the surveyed students the reading habits lean towards infrequent book consumption.  A significant portion read very few or no books at all within the observed month.  Further research might be needed to understand the reasons behind these reading habits.  This might involve looking at factors such as access to books time constraints or personal preferences."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","G","Analyze the given stem-and-leaf plot representing the ages of students in a class to determine the mean age.","To find the mean age from a stem-and-leaf plot you need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract the data:**  Carefully read the stem-and-leaf plot to reconstruct the individual data points (the ages of the students).  Remember how stem-and-leaf plots work: the ""stem"" represents the tens digit (or hundreds etc. depending on the scale) and the ""leaf"" represents the ones digit.  Write down each age as a separate number.

2. **Sum the data:** Add up all the individual ages you extracted in step 1.

3. **Count the data points:** Determine the total number of students (data points) in the class.  This is simply the total number of leaves in the stem-and-leaf plot.

4. **Calculate the mean:** Divide the sum of the ages (from step 2) by the total number of students (from step 3).  The result is the mean age.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a stem-and-leaf plot like this:

```
Stem | Leaf
-----|-----
1    | 2 5 8
2    | 0 3 7 9
3    | 1 5
```

1. **Extract the data:** The ages are: 12 15 18 20 23 27 29 31 35

2. **Sum the data:** 12 + 15 + 18 + 20 + 23 + 27 + 29 + 31 + 35 = 210

3. **Count the data points:** There are 9 students.

4. **Calculate the mean:** 210 / 9 = 23.33 (approximately)

Therefore the mean age of the students is approximately 23.33 years.  Remember to round your answer appropriately based on the context of the problem."

1. **Count the total number of data points:** Add up all the leaves in the stem-and-leaf plot.  This gives you the total number of student scores.

2. **Determine the median position:** The median is the middle value.  If the total number of data points (N) is odd the median is the (N+1)/2 th value. If N is even the median is the average of the N/2 th and (N/2 + 1)th values.

3. **Locate the median value(s) in the stem-and-leaf plot:** Once you know the position(s) of the median locate the corresponding score(s) in the plot. Remember the stem represents the tens digit (or whatever place value is indicated) and the leaf represents the ones digit.

4. **Calculate the median (if necessary):** If you have an even number of data points average the two middle scores to find the median.

**Example:**

Let's say you have this stem-and-leaf plot:

```
Stem | Leaf
-----|-----
  6  | 2 5 8
  7  | 1 3 4 7 9
  8  | 0 2 5
```

1. **Count data points:** There are 3 + 5 + 3 = 11 scores.

2. **Median position:**  Since N = 11 (odd) the median is the (11+1)/2 = 6th value.

3. **Locate the median:** Counting from the lowest score the 6th score is 74 (the fourth leaf in the stem 7).

4. **Median:** The median score is 74.


**If the number of data points was even:**

Let's say we added another score of 91 to the example above.  Now we have 12 scores.

1. **Count data points:**  N = 12

2. **Median position:** The median is the average of the 6th and 7th values.

3. **Locate the median values:** The 6th value is still 74 and the 7th value is 79.

4. **Calculate the median:** (74 + 79) / 2 = 76.5.  The median score is 76.5.

* **1|4:** Represents 14 books
* **1|7:** Represents 17 books
* **2|0:** Represents 20 books (appears twice)
* **2|3:** Represents 23 books

By counting you'll see that '5' and '12' and '20' each appear twice—more frequently than any other value.  Therefore this dataset is multimodal and the modes are 5 12 and 20.  You would list all three as the mode.

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","E","Design a survey to find out your classmates' favorite fruit collect the data and create a bar graph to display the results.","This task involves three steps: designing a survey collecting data and creating a bar graph.  Let's break each step down:

**Step 1: Designing the Survey**

Your survey should be simple and straightforward to ensure accurate data collection.  Here's how to design it:

1. **Question:** Keep it concise.  A simple question like ""What is your favorite fruit?"" is sufficient.

2. **Response Options:**  List a selection of common fruits. You could include:
    * Apples
    * Bananas
    * Oranges
    * Strawberries
    * Grapes
    * Mangoes
    * Pineapple
    * Other (with a space to write in their answer)  – This is crucial to capture fruits you might not have initially considered.

3. **Format:**  You can choose how to administer the survey:
    * **Paper Survey:**  Create a physical sheet with the question and response options.
    * **Online Survey:** Use a free tool like Google Forms SurveyMonkey (limited free version) or even a simple poll on social media (if appropriate for your class). Online surveys are easier to analyze but might require more technical skill to set up.

**Step 2: Collecting Data**

1. **Distribution:** Distribute your survey to your classmates.  Make sure to get a good sample size (the more responses the more reliable your results).

2. **Response Collection:** Gather all completed surveys. If using an online tool you'll have the data compiled automatically. If using a paper survey carefully tally the responses for each fruit.  Create a table like this:

| Fruit        | Number of Students |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Apples       |                    |
| Bananas      |                    |
| Oranges      |                    |
| Strawberries |                    |
| Grapes       |                    |
| Mangoes      |                    |
| Pineapple    |                    |
| Other        |                    |


**Step 3: Creating a Bar Graph**

1. **Choose Your Tools:** You can create a bar graph using various tools:
    * **Hand-drawn:**  If you prefer you can draw it by hand on graph paper.
    * **Spreadsheet Software:**  Excel Google Sheets or LibreOffice Calc are excellent choices. They automatically generate graphs based on your data.
    * **Online Graph Makers:**  Many free websites offer graph creation tools.  Search for ""free online bar graph maker.""

2. **Graph Elements:** Your bar graph should include:
    * **Title:**  For example ""Classmates' Favorite Fruits""
    * **X-axis (Horizontal):**  List the different fruits.
    * **Y-axis (Vertical):** Represents the number of students who chose each fruit. Label this axis ""Number of Students.""
    * **Bars:** Each fruit should have a bar whose height corresponds to the number of students who chose that fruit.  All bars should have the same width.

3. **Interpreting the Data:** Once your bar graph is complete analyze the results. Which fruit is the most popular?  Which is the least popular?  Are there any surprises?


**Example using Google Sheets:**

1. Enter your data from the table into a Google Sheet with fruits in one column and the number of students in the next.
2. Select the data.
3. Go to ""Insert"" > ""Chart.""
4. Choose ""Bar chart"" from the options.
5. Google Sheets will automatically generate a bar graph. You can customize the title labels and colors as needed.


By following these steps you'll successfully complete the task and gain valuable experience in data collection and visualization. Remember to keep your survey concise and your graph clear and easy to understand."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","E","Conduct a survey asking 10 friends about the number of hours they spend on homework each week then represent the findings with a bar graph.","Here's how to complete this task:

**1. Conduct the Survey:**

* **Prepare your question:** Keep it simple and clear.  For example: ""On average how many hours per week do you spend on homework?""
* **Choose your friends:** Select 10 friends who are willing to participate.
* **Gather the data:** Ask each of your 10 friends the question and record their answers.  Write down the name (optional you can use numbers 1-10) and their response (number of hours).

**2. Organize the Data:**

* **Create a frequency table:** This helps you visualize the data before creating the bar graph.  List the number of hours (this will be your x-axis) and count how many friends reported each number of hours (this will be your y-axis). For example:

| Hours of Homework | Number of Friends |
|---|---|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | 2 |
| 5 | 2 |
| 6+ | 0 |


**3. Create the Bar Graph:**

* **Choose your axes:** The horizontal axis (x-axis) represents the number of hours spent on homework. The vertical axis (y-axis) represents the number of friends who reported that number of hours.
* **Label your axes:** Clearly label both axes with the appropriate titles (""Hours of Homework"" and ""Number of Friends"").
* **Draw the bars:** For each number of hours draw a bar whose height corresponds to the number of friends who reported that amount.  All bars should have the same width.
* **Add a title:** Give your bar graph a clear and concise title such as ""Weekly Homework Hours of 10 Friends"".

**Example (using the frequency table above):**

Imagine you have graph paper or are using software like Excel Google Sheets or a dedicated graphing tool.

* **X-axis:** 0 1 2 3 4 5 6+ (hours of homework)
* **Y-axis:** 0 1 2 3 4 5 (Number of friends)

You'd then draw bars:

* A bar above ""1"" reaching the ""2"" mark on the y-axis.
* A bar above ""2"" reaching the ""3"" mark on the y-axis.
* A bar above ""3"" reaching the ""1"" mark on the y-axis.
* And so on for the rest of your data.


**Tools to help:**

* **Graph paper:**  Good for hand-drawn graphs.
* **Spreadsheet software (Excel Google Sheets):**  These programs have built-in charting tools that make creating bar graphs easy.  You just input your data and select ""Bar chart"" as the chart type.
* **Online graphing tools:** Many free online tools can create bar graphs from your data.  Just search for ""online bar graph maker.""

**1. Data Collection:**

* **Survey your family:** Talk to each member of your family (parents siblings etc.) and ask them what their preferred mode of transportation is when traveling for everyday activities (commuting shopping visiting friends etc.).  Make sure to clarify that you're looking for their *preferred* method not necessarily their *most frequent* method. Someone might always take the car but *prefer* to walk if possible.
* **Create a list:**  Keep a list of each family member's response. For example:
    * Mom: Car
    * Dad: Public Transport
    * Sister: Bike
    * Brother: Walking
    * You: Car

**2. Data Organization:**

* **Tally the responses:** Count how many times each mode of transportation was chosen.
    * Car: 2
    * Public Transport: 1
    * Bike: 1
    * Walking: 1

**3. Bar Graph Creation:**

You can create your bar graph using several methods:

* **Hand-drawn:**  Use graph paper or even just plain paper. Draw a horizontal axis (x-axis) to represent the modes of transportation (Car Bike Walking Public Transport).  Draw a vertical axis (y-axis) to represent the frequency (number of people).  For each mode of transportation draw a bar whose height corresponds to the number of times it was chosen.  Remember to label your axes and give your graph a title (e.g. ""Family's Preferred Modes of Transportation"").

* **Spreadsheet Software (like Google Sheets Microsoft Excel):**  This is the easiest and most accurate method.
    * **Enter your data:** Create a table with two columns: ""Mode of Transportation"" and ""Frequency.""  Enter your tallied data.
    * **Insert a chart:** Most spreadsheet programs have a built-in chart function. Select your data then choose the ""bar chart"" option.  The software will automatically generate the graph. You can then customize it with labels titles and colors.

* **Online Chart Makers:** Many free online tools (search for ""online bar chart maker"") allow you to input data and create a bar graph without needing any software.

**Example using Spreadsheet Software:**

| Mode of Transportation | Frequency |
|---|---|
| Car | 2 |
| Public Transport | 1 |
| Bike | 1 |
| Walking | 1 |


After entering this data into a spreadsheet you'd use the charting function to automatically generate a bar graph showing the 2 people preferring cars 1 preferring public transport 1 preferring bikes and 1 preferring walking.


Remember to clearly label your axes and give your graph a title for easy understanding.  The resulting bar graph will visually represent your family's preferences for modes of transportation."

* **Add up all the numbers:** 3 + 5 + 2 + 8 + 4 = 22
* **Divide the sum by the total number of values:** 22 / 5 = 4.4

The mean number of books read is 4.4.

**2. Calculate the Median (Middle Value):**

* **Arrange the numbers in ascending order:** 2 3 4 5 8
* **Find the middle value:** Since there are 5 numbers (an odd number) the median is the middle number which is 4.

The median number of books read is 4."

* **Sum the ages:** Add all the ages together: 22 + 25 + 19 + 30 + 28 + 24 = 148
* **Divide by the number of participants:** There are 6 participants so divide the sum by 6: 148 / 6 = 24.67

Therefore the mean age is approximately **24.67**.

**2. Median (Middle Value):**

* **Arrange the ages in ascending order:** 19 22 24 25 28 30
* **Find the middle value:** Since there are an even number of ages (6) the median is the average of the two middle values.  The two middle values are 24 and 25.
* **Calculate the average of the middle values:** (24 + 25) / 2 = 24.5

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Evaluate the given histogram showing the number of books read by students in a month and determine which student category has the highest frequency.","To determine which student category has the highest frequency from a histogram showing the number of books read follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Histogram's Axes:**  The horizontal axis (x-axis) of the histogram represents the number of books read (e.g. 0 books 1 book 2 books etc.). The vertical axis (y-axis) represents the frequency – the number of students who read that many books.  Each bar represents a range of books read or a specific number and the height of the bar shows how many students fall into that category.

2. **Identify the Tallest Bar:**  Visually inspect the histogram. The tallest bar represents the category (number of books read) with the highest frequency.  That is the most students fall into that category.

3. **Determine the Category:** Note the value on the x-axis corresponding to the tallest bar. This value indicates the number of books read that has the highest frequency amongst the students. This is your answer.  For example if the tallest bar is above ""2 books"" then the student category with the highest frequency is ""students who read 2 books.""


**Example:**

Let's say your histogram looks like this (a simplified example):

* 0 books: Bar height = 5
* 1 book: Bar height = 10
* 2 books: Bar height = 15
* 3 books: Bar height = 8
* 4 books: Bar height = 2

The tallest bar is at ""2 books"" with a height of 15. Therefore the student category with the highest frequency is ""students who read 2 books."""
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Analyze the histogram that represents daily temperatures over a month and discuss whether the data appears to show a consistent pattern or significant fluctuations.","To analyze a histogram of daily temperatures and determine if it shows a consistent pattern or significant fluctuations follow these steps:

**1. Examine the overall shape of the histogram:**

* **Symmetry:** Is the histogram roughly symmetrical around a central value (meaning the data is normally distributed) or is it skewed (leaning to one side)?  A skewed histogram suggests a consistent bias towards higher or lower temperatures.
* **Modality:** How many peaks (modes) does the histogram have?  A unimodal histogram (one peak) suggests a relatively consistent pattern while a multimodal histogram (multiple peaks) might indicate distinct periods with different temperature characteristics (e.g. a warm spell followed by a cold snap).
* **Spread:** How wide is the histogram? A narrow histogram indicates temperatures clustered closely around a central value (consistent temperatures) while a wide histogram suggests significant variation.

**2. Identify the central tendency:**

* **Mean:** The average temperature.  This gives a general idea of the typical temperature for the month.
* **Median:** The middle value when the temperatures are ordered. This is less affected by outliers (extremely high or low temperatures) than the mean.
* **Mode:** The most frequent temperature.

Compare the mean median and mode. If they are close together it suggests a relatively consistent pattern. A large difference indicates significant fluctuations.

**3. Look for patterns within the histogram:**

* **Clusters:** Are there distinct clusters of data points at particular temperature ranges? This might suggest periods of consistently higher or lower temperatures.
* **Gaps:** Are there gaps in the data? These could indicate unusual events or missing data.
* **Outliers:** Are there any extremely high or low temperatures that are far from the other data points? These should be noted and their potential causes considered.

**4. Consider the context:**

* **Month:** The month of the year is crucial.  Expect more consistent temperatures in months closer to the equinoxes (March and September) and more variation in winter and summer months.
* **Location:** The geographic location affects expected temperature patterns.


**5. Summarize your findings:**

Based on your observations from steps 1-4 write a concise summary discussing the presence or absence of consistent patterns and significant fluctuations in the daily temperatures. For example:

* ""The histogram shows a unimodal slightly right-skewed distribution of daily temperatures indicating a general tendency towards warmer temperatures with some fluctuations. The mean and median temperatures are relatively close suggesting a fairly consistent average temperature for the month. However the presence of a long right tail indicates several days with significantly higher temperatures than the average contributing to noticeable fluctuations overall.""

* ""The histogram exhibits a bimodal distribution suggesting distinct periods of warmer and cooler temperatures throughout the month. This indicates substantial fluctuations rather than a consistent pattern.""


Remember to support your conclusions with specific details from the histogram such as the range of temperatures the location of the peaks and the presence of any outliers or gaps.  A visual description of the histogram's shape (""bell-shaped"" ""skewed right"" etc.) will also greatly enhance your analysis."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Using the histogram of pets owned by families in your neighborhood compare the frequency of dogs to the frequency of cats and interpret what this might say about pet ownership trends.","To solve this task you need to follow these steps:

**1. Collect the Data:**

* **Create a Histogram:**  You'll need to survey families in your neighborhood to find out how many pets they own specifically focusing on dogs and cats.  A simple survey could ask: ""How many dogs do you own?"" and ""How many cats do you own?"".  Record the responses.
* **Organize the Data:** Once you have your data create a frequency table. This table should list the number of dogs and the number of cats owned by each family.  You can then group this data into ranges (e.g. 0-1 2-3 4-5 etc.) if you have a wide range of pet ownership.
* **Construct the Histogram:** Use the frequency table to create a histogram.  The x-axis will represent the number of pets (or the ranges you created) and the y-axis will represent the frequency (the number of families with that number of pets).  You'll have separate bars for dogs and cats (perhaps different colors).

**2. Compare Frequencies:**

* **Visual Inspection:** Once you have your histogram visually compare the heights of the bars representing dogs and cats.  Which bar is taller for each range? Which one has the most families in total?
* **Calculate Frequencies:** You can calculate the total frequency for dogs and the total frequency for cats by adding up the frequencies for each category in your histogram.

**3. Interpret the Results:**

* **Which pet is more frequent?**  Based on your comparison determine whether dogs or cats are more frequently owned in your neighborhood.
* **Consider possible trends:**  Why might one pet be more popular than the other? Some potential reasons to consider:
    * **Lifestyle:** Do many families have yards suitable for dogs? Are there apartment buildings that might favor cats?
    * **Cultural factors:** Are dogs or cats more popular in your area's culture or demographics?
    * **Cost of ownership:** Are there significant differences in the cost of owning dogs versus cats?
    * **Time commitment:**  Do families have more time for higher-maintenance pets like dogs?
* **Limitations:** Note any limitations of your data.  For example a small sample size (few families surveyed) would weaken your conclusions.

**Example Interpretation:**

Let's say your histogram shows that the total frequency of dogs is significantly higher than the frequency of cats.  You might interpret this as indicating a preference for dog ownership in your neighborhood perhaps due to the prevalence of houses with yards or a cultural inclination towards dogs. However if your survey only included 10 families this conclusion would be less reliable.


In short:  The key is to carefully collect and organize the data create a clear visual representation (the histogram) and then use logical reasoning to explain the observed differences in the frequency of dog and cat ownership. Remember to acknowledge the limitations of your data."

2. **Examine the horizontal axis:** This axis represents the days of the week.

3. **Find the highest point on the line:**  The line on the graph shows the temperature for each day. Locate the highest point on this line.

4. **Read the temperature value:**  From the highest point on the line trace a line straight down to the horizontal axis to find the day.  Then trace a line straight across to the vertical axis to read the temperature value at that highest point.  This is the highest temperature recorded during the week.

**Example:** If the highest point on the line is above the ""25°C"" mark on the vertical axis then the highest temperature recorded was 25°C (or whatever the corresponding value is depending on the scale of your graph)."

1. **Find the 70°F mark on the vertical axis (y-axis).** This axis represents temperature.

2. **Draw a horizontal line across the graph at the 70°F mark.** This line will intersect the temperature line at various points.

3. **Examine the points where your horizontal line intersects the temperature line.**  Each intersection point corresponds to a day.

4. **Count the number of days where the temperature line is *above* your horizontal 70°F line.**  These are the days with temperatures higher than 70°F.  The horizontal axis (x-axis) usually represents the days.

1. **Identify the Summer Months:** First determine which months are considered ""summer"" in the context of the graph.  This is usually June July and August but it could vary depending on the location or the graph's specific definition.

2. **Focus on Summer Data:**  Ignore all data points outside of the designated summer months.  You only need to analyze the bars representing sales for June July and August.

3. **Identify the Highest Bar for Each Flavor:** For each ice cream flavor shown on the graph look at the height of the bars representing its sales during the summer months.

4. **Determine the Highest-Selling Flavor:** The flavor with the tallest bar(s) (representing the highest sales total over the summer months combined) is the top seller. If the graph shows sales for each month individually add the sales for June July and August for each flavor.

5. **Calculate the Sales Difference:** To find the sales difference between the highest-selling flavor and each other flavor subtract the sales of the other flavors from the sales of the highest-selling flavor *for the summer months only*.

6. **Present Your Findings:** State which flavor had the highest sales during the summer and for each other flavor state how many more units (or dollars depending on the graph's units) the top-selling flavor sold compared to it.  For example: ""Chocolate had the highest summer sales. It outsold Strawberry by 500 units Vanilla by 750 units and Mint Chocolate Chip by 1000 units.""


**Example:**

Let's say your graph shows the following summer sales (in units):

* **Chocolate:** June - 800 July - 1000 August - 900  (Total: 2700)
* **Strawberry:** June - 500 July - 600 August - 400  (Total: 1500)
* **Vanilla:** June - 600 July - 700 August - 600  (Total: 1900)

Chocolate had the highest sales.

* Chocolate vs. Strawberry: 2700 - 1500 = 1200 units difference
* Chocolate vs. Vanilla: 2700 - 1900 = 800 units difference

Therefore you would conclude: ""Chocolate had the highest ice cream sales during the summer.  It outsold Strawberry by 1200 units and Vanilla by 800 units.""

**1. Data Extraction:**

* **Identify the data:** Carefully examine the bar graph.  For each month note the sales figures (likely in units or monetary value) for each sneaker brand (let's call them Brand A and Brand B).  Organize this data into a table.  A sample table might look like this:

| Month | Brand A Sales | Brand B Sales |
|---|---|---|
| January | 100 | 150 |
| February | 120 | 130 |
| March | 150 | 160 |

**2. Calculate Total Sales:**

* **Sum the sales:**  For each brand add up the sales for all the months.  This will give you the total sales for Brand A and Brand B over the period shown in the graph.

* **Example:**  Let's say after summing Brand A's total sales are 800 and Brand B's total sales are 950.

**3. Identify the Brand with Higher Total Sales:**

* **Compare totals:** Determine which brand (A or B) had the higher total sales. In our example Brand B has higher total sales.

**4. Calculate Percentage Increase:**

* **Find the difference:**  Subtract the lower total sales from the higher total sales.  In our example: 950 (Brand B) - 800 (Brand A) = 150

* **Calculate the percentage increase:** Divide the difference by the lower total sales and then multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.

   Percentage increase = [(Higher Total Sales - Lower Total Sales) / Lower Total Sales] * 100

   In our example: (150 / 800) * 100 = 18.75%

**5. State your conclusion:**

* Clearly state your findings. For instance: ""Brand B had 18.75% higher total sales than Brand A over the period shown.""


**Important Note:**  If the graph shows sales in units your answer will be a percentage increase in units sold. If it shows sales in monetary value (e.g. dollars) your answer will be a percentage increase in revenue.  Make sure to clearly state the units in your conclusion."

The data is clustered towards the lower values with a few high outliers pulling the mean upward.  Think of it like a tail pointing to the right.

* **Negative Skew (Left Skew):** The tail on the left-hand side is longer than the tail on the right. The mean is typically less than the median which is less than the mode. The data is clustered towards the higher values with a few low outliers pulling the mean downward.  Think of it like a tail pointing to the left.

* **Symmetrical:** The tails on both sides are approximately equal in length. The mean median and mode are roughly equal.  The distribution is balanced around the center.


**In short:**  Visualize the histogram. Does it have a long tail to the right (positive skew) a long tail to the left (negative skew) or are the tails roughly equal (symmetrical)?  Your answer should explicitly state which type of skewness you observed and *why* referencing the longer tail and the relative positions of the peak and the bulk of the data."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Calculate the mean and median of the data represented in the histogram and discuss which measure of central tendency better represents the dataset.","To calculate the mean and median from a histogram you can't directly use the graphical representation.  You need to reconstruct the original data (or a close approximation) from the histogram's bars. Here's how:

**1. Reconstructing the Data:**

* **Identify the class intervals:**  A histogram shows data grouped into intervals (bins). Note the lower and upper bounds of each interval.
* **Determine the frequency of each interval:**  The height of each bar represents the frequency (number of data points) falling within that interval.
* **Approximate the midpoint of each interval:** For each interval calculate the midpoint by averaging the lower and upper bounds.  This midpoint will represent the value of all data points within that interval for mean calculation.
* **Create a frequency table:** Create a table with columns for:
    * **Interval:** The range of values for each bin
    * **Midpoint (x):** The midpoint of each interval.
    * **Frequency (f):** The number of data points in each interval.

**2. Calculating the Mean:**

The mean is calculated as follows:

* **Multiply each midpoint by its frequency:** Calculate `x * f` for each row of your frequency table.
* **Sum the products:** Add up all the values obtained in the previous step: Σ(x * f)
* **Sum the frequencies:** Add up all the frequencies: Σf
* **Divide the sum of products by the sum of frequencies:** Mean = Σ(x * f) / Σf

**3. Calculating the Median:**

The median is the middle value when the data is ordered.  Since we only have intervals and frequencies we need to estimate:

* **Find the cumulative frequency:** Add a column to your frequency table for cumulative frequency.  This is the running total of frequencies.
* **Locate the median position:** The median position is (Σf + 1) / 2.
* **Identify the median interval:** Find the interval where the cumulative frequency first equals or exceeds the median position.
* **Estimate the median value:**  This requires interpolation.  Let's say the median interval is [a b] with a frequency of 'f_median' and a cumulative frequency up to the start of this interval of 'cf_before'.  Then estimate the median using linear interpolation:

   Median ≈ a + [( (Σf + 1) / 2 - cf_before) / f_median] * (b - a)

**4.  Comparing Mean and Median:**

Compare the calculated mean and median.  Consider these points:

* **Skewness:** If the mean is significantly greater than the median the distribution is right-skewed (a long tail to the right).  If the mean is significantly less than the median the distribution is left-skewed (a long tail to the left).
* **Outliers:**  Outliers greatly influence the mean but have less impact on the median.  A large difference suggests the presence of outliers.

**Which Measure is Better?**

* **Symmetrical Distribution:** If the histogram is approximately symmetrical the mean and median will be close and either is a good representation of the central tendency.
* **Skewed Distribution:** In a skewed distribution the median is generally a better measure of central tendency because it is less sensitive to outliers and skewness.  The mean will be pulled towards the tail of the skewed distribution.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a histogram with the following intervals and frequencies:

| Interval | Midpoint (x) | Frequency (f) | Cumulative Frequency | x*f |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10-19 | 14.5 | 2 | 2 | 29 |
| 20-29 | 24.5 | 5 | 7 | 122.5 |
| 30-39 | 34.5 | 8 | 15 | 276 |
| 40-49 | 44.5 | 3 | 18 | 133.5 |

Σf = 18
Σ(x * f) = 561

Mean = 561 / 18 ≈ 31.17

Median position = (18 + 1) / 2 = 9.5.  The median interval is 30-39.

Median ≈ 30 + [(9.5 - 7) / 8] * (39 - 30) ≈ 32.81

In this example the mean (31.17) and median (32.81) are close.  The slight difference might indicate a minor skew.  However without seeing the actual histogram's shape it's difficult to determine whether this difference is significant or not.


Remember to always carefully examine the histogram's shape to make an informed decision about which measure better represents the data."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Using the histogram provided identify the mode of the data and evaluate what this indicates about the most frequent occurrence in the dataset.","To find the mode using a histogram follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Bin with the Highest Frequency:** Look at the histogram bars.  The tallest bar represents the bin (range of values) with the highest frequency—meaning the most data points fall within that range.

2. **Determine the Mode (or Modal Class):** The mode is *not* a single value in this case because a histogram groups data into bins. Instead the mode is the *modal class* or *modal bin*.  This is the range of values represented by the tallest bar.  For example if the tallest bar represents the range 20-25 then the modal class is 20-25.

3. **Interpret the Meaning:** The modal class indicates the range of values that occur most frequently in your dataset.  It tells you something about the central tendency of the data but note it's not the same as the mean (average) or the median (middle value). It speaks specifically to the most common *range* of values.


**Example:**

Let's say your histogram shows the following:

* Bin 10-15:  Frequency 5
* Bin 15-20: Frequency 8
* Bin 20-25: Frequency 12
* Bin 25-30: Frequency 7
* Bin 30-35: Frequency 3

The tallest bar is for the bin 20-25 with a frequency of 12. Therefore:

* **Mode (Modal Class):** 20-25
* **Interpretation:** The most frequent occurrences in this dataset fall within the range of 20 to 25.  This tells us something about the typical or most common value but it doesn't tell us the *exact* most frequent value (since the data is grouped).


**Important Note:** If there are two or more bins with the same highest frequency the data is multimodal (has multiple modes).  You'd report all the modal classes.  A histogram with a completely flat top has no mode (or is uniformly distributed)."

* **Probability of making a three-pointer:** 60% or 0.6

**Probability of making both = (Probability of making a free throw) * (Probability of making a three-pointer)**

The quality of one doesn't affect the quality of the other.  Therefore you can simply multiply the individual probabilities.

1. **Probability of a good light bulb:** 90% = 0.9

2. **Probability of a good battery:** 85% = 0.85

2. **Probability of rolling a four:** A standard six-sided die has six possible outcomes (1 2 3 4 5 6). The probability of rolling a four is 1/6.

3. **Probability of both events happening:** Since the events are independent you multiply their individual probabilities:

   (Probability of heads) * (Probability of rolling a four) = (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12

Therefore the probability of flipping heads and rolling a four is $\boxed{1/12}$ or approximately 0.0833."

**1. Probability of the first card being a heart:**

* A standard deck has 52 cards and 13 of them are hearts.
* The probability of drawing a heart on the first draw is therefore 13/52 (which simplifies to 1/4).

**2. Probability of the second card being a heart *given* the first card was a heart:**

* After drawing one heart there are only 51 cards left in the deck.
* Of those 51 cards only 12 are hearts (since we've already drawn one).
* The probability of drawing a second heart given the first was a heart is 12/51.

**3. Probability of both events happening:**

To find the probability of both events (drawing a heart then drawing another heart) we multiply the probabilities of each event:

(Probability of first heart) * (Probability of second heart given first heart) = (13/52) * (12/51) = 1/4 * 12/51 = 12/204

**4. Simplifying the result:**

The fraction 12/204 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 12:

(4/52) * (4/51) = 16/2652

Here's how to break it down:

1. **Probability of drawing the Queen of Spades first:** There's only one Queen of Spades in a standard 52-card deck.  Therefore the probability of drawing it first is 1/52.

2. **Probability of drawing the Jack of Hearts second (given the Queen of Spades was drawn first):** After drawing the Queen of Spades there are only 51 cards left in the deck. Only one of those is the Jack of Hearts.  So the probability of drawing the Jack of Hearts second *given* that the Queen of Spades was already drawn is 1/51.

You can solve it in two main ways:

**Method 1:  Step-by-step calculation**

1. **Year 1:** Calculate the depreciation for the first year:  $20000 * 0.15 = $3000.  Subtract this from the original value: $20000 - $3000 = $17000.

2. **Year 2:** Calculate the depreciation for the second year based on the *new* value: $17000 * 0.15 = $2550. Subtract this from the year 1 value: $17000 - $2550 = $14450.

3. **Year 3:** Calculate the depreciation for the third year based on the *new* value: $14450 * 0.15 = $2167.50. Subtract this from the year 2 value: $14450 - $2167.50 = $12282.50

Therefore after 3 years the car's value will be **$12282.50**.


**Method 2: Using a formula**

A more efficient method uses the formula for compound depreciation:

Future Value (FV) = Present Value (PV) * (1 - r)^n

Where:

* FV = Future Value (what we want to find)
* PV = Present Value ($20000)
* r = depreciation rate (0.15 or 15%)
* n = number of years (3)

Plugging in the values:

FV = $20000 * (1 - 0.15)^3
FV = $20000 * (0.85)^3
FV = $20000 * 0.614125

**1. Draw the first set (3 apples to 2 oranges):**

* **Apples:** Draw three apples.  They can be simple drawings; you don't need to be artistic.  Just make them clearly identifiable as apples.
* **Oranges:**  Draw two oranges next to the apples.  Again simple drawings are fine.

**2. Draw the second set (6 apples to 4 oranges):**

* **Apples:** Draw six apples. This is double the number of apples in the first set.
* **Oranges:** Draw four oranges. This is double the number of oranges in the first set.

**3. Visual Representation of Equivalence:**

To visually represent the equivalent ratio you can arrange your drawings in a way that clearly shows the doubling. For example:

* You could draw the first set (3 apples 2 oranges) and then directly beside it draw the second set (6 apples 4 oranges).  This visually demonstrates that the second set is simply a larger version of the first maintaining the same ratio.
* Alternatively you could arrange them in a grid or other structure that highlights the relationship between the two sets of fruits.

**Key Point:** The crucial aspect is that both sets clearly show the 3:2 ratio. The second set while having more fruit maintains the same proportional relationship between apples and oranges.  It's about demonstrating the concept of equivalent ratios visually."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","C","If Jamie can read 4 books in 2 weeks create a bar graph to show how many books she would read in 6 weeks using equivalent ratios.","Here's how to solve this problem and create the bar graph:

**1. Find the unit rate:**

* Jamie reads 4 books in 2 weeks.  To find the unit rate (books per week) divide the number of books by the number of weeks: 4 books / 2 weeks = 2 books/week

**2. Calculate books read in 6 weeks:**

* Now that we know Jamie reads 2 books per week multiply the unit rate by the number of weeks: 2 books/week * 6 weeks = 12 books

**3. Create the Bar Graph:**

* **Horizontal Axis (x-axis):** Label this ""Time (Weeks)"".  Mark increments along the axis perhaps by 1 week each (0 1 2 3 4 5 6).
* **Vertical Axis (y-axis):** Label this ""Number of Books Read"". Mark increments appropriate for the data perhaps by 2 books each (0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14).
* **Bars:** Draw a bar that goes up to the ""12"" mark on the y-axis above the ""6"" mark on the x-axis. This represents the 12 books read in 6 weeks.  You can also optionally add a bar for 4 books at 2 weeks to visually show the equivalent ratio.

**Example of the bar graph data:**

| Time (Weeks) | Number of Books |
|---|---|
| 2 | 4 |
| 6 | 12 |


**Using equivalent ratios (optional but helpful for understanding):**

You can also solve this using equivalent ratios directly:

* We have the ratio 4 books : 2 weeks.  To find the equivalent ratio for 6 weeks set up a proportion:

   4/2 = x/6

* Cross-multiply:  2x = 24

* Solve for x: x = 12 books

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","C","Using colored blocks build a model that represents the ratio of 5 blue blocks to 3 yellow blocks and then find and illustrate at least one equivalent ratio.","To solve this task follow these steps:

**1. Build the initial model:**

* **Gather your blocks:** You'll need 5 blue blocks and 3 yellow blocks.
* **Construct the model:** Arrange the 5 blue blocks together and separately arrange the 3 yellow blocks together.  This visually represents the ratio 5:3 (5 blue to 3 yellow).  You can physically arrange them in a row or a group to clearly show the separation.

**2. Find an equivalent ratio:**

An equivalent ratio is a ratio that represents the same proportion.  You find it by multiplying (or dividing) both parts of the ratio by the same number.

* **Example 1 (Multiplication):** Multiply both the number of blue blocks and the number of yellow blocks by 2.  This gives you 10 blue blocks and 6 yellow blocks.  The ratio 10:6 is equivalent to 5:3.

* **Example 2 (Multiplication):** Multiply both the number of blue blocks and the number of yellow blocks by 3.  This gives you 15 blue blocks and 9 yellow blocks. The ratio 15:9 is equivalent to 5:3.

* **Illustrate the equivalent ratio:**  Once you've chosen an equivalent ratio (let's say 10:6) build a second model using 10 blue blocks and 6 yellow blocks arranged similarly to your first model. This demonstrates that the proportion remains the same even though the number of blocks has increased.


**In summary:**

Your solution should show two distinct models:

* **Model 1:**  5 blue blocks and 3 yellow blocks representing the ratio 5:3.
* **Model 2:** 10 blue blocks and 6 yellow blocks (or another equivalent ratio like 15:9) representing an equivalent ratio to 5:3.

Both models visually demonstrate that the proportion of blue to yellow blocks remains consistent illustrating the concept of equivalent ratios.  The key is that you've multiplied (or divided) both parts of the original ratio by the same factor to create the equivalent ratio."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Linear and other simple functions","D","Create a table of values for the linear function y = 2x + 3 then plot the points on a graph and describe the slope.","Here's how to solve this task step-by-step:

**1. Create a table of values:**

Choose several values for 'x' and substitute them into the equation y = 2x + 3 to find the corresponding 'y' values.  It's helpful to choose both positive and negative values and zero.  Here's an example:

| x    | y = 2x + 3 | y   |
|------|-------------|-----|
| -2   | 2(-2) + 3   | -1  |
| -1   | 2(-1) + 3   | 1   |
| 0    | 2(0) + 3    | 3   |
| 1    | 2(1) + 3    | 5   |
| 2    | 2(2) + 3    | 7   |


**2. Plot the points on a graph:**

Draw a coordinate plane (x-axis and y-axis).  Each row in your table represents a point (x y). Plot each point on your graph.  For example the first row (-2 -1) means you go 2 units to the left on the x-axis and 1 unit down on the y-axis to place your first point.

**3. Describe the slope:**

The slope of a linear function represents the steepness and direction of the line.  In the equation y = mx + b 'm' represents the slope and 'b' represents the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis).

* **In your equation y = 2x + 3 the slope (m) is 2.**

This means that for every 1 unit increase in x y increases by 2 units.  The line will slope upwards from left to right because the slope is positive.  A positive slope indicates a positive relationship between x and y (as x increases y increases).

**In Summary:**  After plotting your points you should see that they form a straight line. The slope of this line is 2 indicating a positive and relatively steep incline.  The y-intercept is 3 meaning the line crosses the y-axis at the point (0 3)."

The total cost depends on a fixed fee (the registration) and a variable cost (the monthly fee).

**1. Write the Equation:**

The total cost (C) is the sum of the registration fee and the monthly fees.  The monthly fee is $10 multiplied by the number of months (m). Therefore the equation is:

C = 10m + 20

**2. Create a Table of Values:**

Choose several values for 'm' (number of months) and calculate the corresponding 'C' (total cost) using the equation.  Here's an example:

| Months (m) | Total Cost (C) = 10m + 20 |
|---|---|
| 0 | 10(0) + 20 = 20 |
| 1 | 10(1) + 20 = 30 |
| 2 | 10(2) + 20 = 40 |
| 3 | 10(3) + 20 = 50 |
| 4 | 10(4) + 20 = 60 |
| 5 | 10(5) + 20 = 70 |


**3. Graph the Function:**

To graph this use the table of values.  The x-axis represents the number of months (m) and the y-axis represents the total cost (C).

* **Plot the points:**  Plot each (m C) pair from your table on the graph. For example (0 20) (1 30) (2 40) etc.
* **Draw the line:**  Since this is a linear function draw a straight line through all the plotted points.  The line should start at (0 20)  (the y-intercept representing the registration fee).  The line will have a positive slope (it goes up from left to right) because the cost increases with each month.

**Important Note for the Graph:**

* The graph should only show positive values for 'm' (you can't have a negative number of months).
* The y-intercept should be clearly marked at (0 20).
* Label your axes (Months (m) and Total Cost (C)) and give your graph a title (e.g. ""Gym Membership Cost"").

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Linear and other simple functions","D","If a bike rental shop charges $5 for the first hour and $2 for each additional hour find the linear function that represents the cost (C) based on hours (h) plot it and explain the meaning of the slope.","This problem involves creating a piecewise linear function because the cost changes depending on whether you're in the first hour or subsequent hours.  Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**1. Define the function:**

The cost isn't a simple straight line because the rate changes. We need to handle the first hour separately:

* **If h ≤ 1:**  The cost (C) is simply $5.  This is represented as C(h) = 5  for 0 < h ≤ 1.  We exclude h=0 because you can't rent for zero hours.

* **If h > 1:** The cost is $5 for the first hour plus $2 for each additional hour (h - 1). This gives us the equation C(h) = 5 + 2(h - 1).  Simplifying this we get C(h) = 3 + 2h.

Therefore the complete piecewise function is:

```
C(h) = 
  5       if 0 < h ≤ 1
  3 + 2h  if h > 1 
```

**2. Plot the function:**

To plot this you'll have a point at (1 5).  Then for h > 1 you'll have a line with a y-intercept of 3 and a slope of 2.  The line will start at (1 5) and continue upward with a constant slope.

* **For h ≤ 1:**  Plot a point at (1 5).  Since you can't rent for less than 0 hours there's an open circle at (05) because h must be greater than zero.  A solid dot at (15) indicates that the cost is $5 for the first hour

* **For h > 1:**  Plot the line y = 3 + 2h. You can find another point easily; if h = 2 C(2) = 7; so plot (27).  Draw a line through (15) and (27) that extends to the right and upward.

Your graph should show a horizontal line segment at C=5 from (05) (open circle) to (15) (solid dot) and then a line with a positive slope starting at (15) and going upwards.

**3. Explain the meaning of the slope:**

The slope of the line for *h > 1* (the part of the graph that is a straight line) is 2.  This means that for every additional hour you rent the bike *after the first hour* the cost increases by $2.  The slope represents the *rate of change* of the cost with respect to the number of hours.  The slope for the flat line segment at $5 is zero because the cost doesn't change when h is one hour or less.


In summary:  You create a piecewise linear function to reflect the different pricing structure for the first hour versus subsequent hours. Then plot it using points and the slope of the lines.  The slope of the relevant line (for h>1) illustrates the cost increase per additional hour."

**Method 1: Subtraction**

Subtract the amount Maria already has from the total cost of the bike:

250 (bike cost) - 75 (money she has) = x (money she needs)

x = $175

**Method 2: Solving the Equation**

The equation x + 75 = 250 represents the same problem. To solve for x (the amount of money Maria still needs):

1. **Isolate x:**  Subtract 75 from *both* sides of the equation to get x by itself.

   x + 75 - 75 = 250 - 75

2. **Simplify:**

The temperature starts at 20 degrees Celsius and increases by 15 degrees.  To find the new temperature simply add the increase to the original temperature:

20°C + 15°C = 35°C

The new temperature will be 35 degrees Celsius.

**Method 2: Solving the algebraic equation**

The equation is x - 15 = 20.  To solve for x you need to isolate x on one side of the equation.  Do this by adding 15 to *both* sides of the equation:

x - 15 + 15 = 20 + 15

The balance increases by a constant amount each month.  Here's how to solve it:

**Method 1: Step-by-step calculation**

1. **Month 1:** $100 + $15 = $115
2. **Month 2:** $115 + $15 = $130
3. **Month 3:** $130 + $15 = $145
4. **Month 4:** $145 + $15 = $160
5. **Month 5:** $160 + $15 = $175
6. **Month 6:** $175 + $15 = $190

The balance after the 6th month will be $190.


**Method 2: Using the formula for an arithmetic sequence**

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:

a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + (n - 1)d

Where:

* a<sub>n</sub> is the nth term (the balance after n months)
* a<sub>1</sub> is the first term (the starting balance)
* n is the number of terms (number of months)
* d is the common difference (the amount added each month)

In this case:

* a<sub>1</sub> = $100
* n = 6
* d = $15

Plugging these values into the formula:

a<sub>6</sub> = $100 + (6 - 1) * $15 = $100 + 5 * $15 = $100 + $75 = $175  (There's a mistake in the first method. This is the correct one)

The balance after the 6th month will be $175.


**Conclusion:**  Method 2 is more efficient for larger numbers of months.  The correct answer is $\boxed{$175}$"

To find the next number you can use one of two methods:

**Method 1:  Observing the Pattern of Differences**

1. **Find the differences between consecutive numbers:**
   * 3 - 1 = 2
   * 6 - 3 = 3
   * 10 - 6 = 4

2. **Identify the pattern:** The differences increase by 1 each time.

3. **Continue the pattern:** The next difference would be 4 + 1 = 5.

**Method 2: Using the Formula**

The nth triangular number can be calculated using the formula:  `n * (n + 1) / 2`

1. **Identify the position:** The given numbers are the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th triangular numbers.

2. **Find the next position:** The next number in the sequence would be the 5th triangular number.

3. **Apply the formula:**  Using n = 5 the formula becomes:  5 * (5 + 1) / 2 = 15

2. **Identify the algebraic rule:**  The general formula for an arithmetic sequence is:  a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + (n-1)d  where:

**1. Finding the 10th term (a₁₀):**

The formula for the nth term of the sequence is given as  a<sub>n</sub> = 5n - 2.  To find the 10th term (a₁₀) simply substitute n = 10 into the formula:

Therefore the 10th term of the sequence is 48.


**2. Finding the sum of the first 5 terms (S₅):**

There are two ways to approach this:

**Method A:  Calculate each term and sum them.**

1. Find the first five terms (a₁ a₂ a₃ a₄ a₅) by substituting n = 1 2 3 4 and 5 into the formula:
   * a₁ = 5(1) - 2 = 3
   * a₂ = 5(2) - 2 = 8
   * a₃ = 5(3) - 2 = 13
   * a₄ = 5(4) - 2 = 18
   * a₅ = 5(5) - 2 = 23

2. Add the terms together: S₅ = 3 + 8 + 13 + 18 + 23 = 65


**Method B: Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.**

Notice that this is an arithmetic sequence (the difference between consecutive terms is constant; it's 5).  The formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is:

S<sub>n</sub> = n/2 * [2a₁ + (n-1)d]

where:

* n = number of terms
* a₁ = the first term
* d = the common difference

In this case:

* n = 5
* a₁ = 3
* d = 5

Substituting these values into the formula:

S₅ = 5/2 * [2(3) + (5-1)5] = 5/2 * [6 + 20] = 5/2 * 26 = 65

Therefore the sum of the first 5 terms is 65.  Method B is generally faster for larger values of 'n'."

**Method 1: Finding the flour per cookie:**

1. **Find the flour per cookie:** Divide the total flour by the number of cookies: 2 cups / 12 cookies = 1/6 cup per cookie.

2. **Calculate flour for 30 cookies:** Multiply the flour per cookie by the desired number of cookies: (1/6 cup/cookie) * 30 cookies = 5 cups.

**Method 2: Using proportions:**

Set up a proportion:

* 2 cups / 12 cookies = x cups / 30 cookies

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","H","A car travels 240 miles on 8 gallons of gas; how many gallons of gas would be required to travel 600 miles?","This is a proportion problem.  You can solve it using several methods:

**Method 1: Finding miles per gallon (MPG)**

1. **Calculate the car's MPG:** Divide the miles traveled by the gallons used: 240 miles / 8 gallons = 30 miles per gallon (mpg)

2. **Calculate gallons needed:** Divide the total miles to travel by the MPG: 600 miles / 30 mpg = 20 gallons

Therefore 20 gallons of gas would be required to travel 600 miles.


**Method 2: Setting up a proportion**

A proportion sets two ratios equal to each other.  Let's use 'x' to represent the unknown number of gallons needed for 600 miles:

* **Ratio 1:** Miles/Gallons = 240 miles / 8 gallons
* **Ratio 2:** Miles/Gallons = 600 miles / x gallons

Set the ratios equal:  240/8 = 600/x

Now solve for x:

* Cross-multiply: 240x = 600 * 8
* Simplify: 240x = 4800
* Divide both sides by 240: x = 20

Therefore x = 20 gallons.

* **""A pencil costs $2 less than a notebook""**:  If the cost of the notebook is 'n' then the cost of the pencil (p) is n - $2.  This gives us the equation:  p = n - 2

* **""Together they cost $6""**: This means the cost of the pencil plus the cost of the notebook equals $6.  This gives us the equation: p + n = 6

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1. p = n - 2
2. p + n = 6

We can solve this system using substitution. Since equation 1 already tells us what 'p' equals substitute  'n - 2'  in place of 'p' in equation 2:

(n - 2) + n = 6

Now solve for 'n':

2n - 2 = 6
2n = 8
n = 4

The notebook costs $4.  Now substitute the value of 'n' (which is 4) back into either of the original equations to find the cost of the pencil.  Let's use equation 1:

p = n - 2
p = 4 - 2
p = 2

Therefore the pencil costs $2.  The equation to find the cost of the pencil using only one variable would be derived from the substitution:  **(n-2) + n = 6**  then simplified to **2n -2 = 6**  and finally solving for n to find p.

The final answer is the pencil costs $2."

* **Sarah's stickers:** Sarah has twice as many stickers as Tim so Sarah has 2t stickers (where 't' represents the number of stickers Tim has).

* **Total stickers:** Together they have 24 stickers.  This means Tim's stickers (t) plus Sarah's stickers (2t) equal 24.

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Recognizing patterns and structures","B","Create a repeating pattern using red blue and yellow colored squares where you use each color in a total of three times.","The key to solving this is to think about arrangements and permutations.  Since you have three colors (red blue yellow) and each color must appear three times you'll have a total of 9 squares in your pattern.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Consider Simple Repeating Units:**  Start by trying to create a small repeating unit that contains all three colors.  This won't necessarily use each color *three* times but it's a good starting point.  For example:  Red-Blue-Yellow.

2. **Repeat and Adjust:**  Now repeat that unit.  Red-Blue-Yellow-Red-Blue-Yellow.  You'll notice this only uses each color twice.

3. **Strategically Add Squares:**  To get to three of each color you'll need to strategically add squares to your repeating unit *or* create a larger more complex repeating unit. You could try these approaches:

   * **Adding to the Unit:**  You could insert a color into your existing unit. For example: Red-Blue-Yellow-Red-Blue-Yellow. You could add a red square to make it Red-Blue-Yellow-Red-**Red**-Blue-Yellow etc. This is trial and error.  You'll have to test different arrangements until you get three of each color.

   * **Creating a Larger Unit:** Instead of a simple 3-square unit try creating a larger repeating unit (e.g. 6 squares or even 9 squares in the final pattern).  This gives you more flexibility to distribute the colors evenly.

4. **Visual Representation:**  Use paper and colored squares or a drawing program to visualize your attempts. This is much faster and easier than trying to work it out purely in your head.

**Example Approach (using a larger unit):**

Let's try a 6-square repeating unit:

1. **Start with a basic pattern:** Red-Blue-Yellow-Red-Blue-Yellow

2. **Rearrange:**  Notice we still only have two of each color. We now need to rearrange them to make it work.  If you experiment you might find a pattern like this works:  Red-Blue-Yellow-Red-Yellow-Blue.  Repeat this.  If you repeat it once (12 total squares) you'll have too many so this route doesn't work.

3. **Try a different 6 square pattern:** Red-Yellow-Blue-Red-Yellow-Blue

**Example Solution (using a 9 square unit):**

A 9-square unit repeating pattern would allow you to directly use each color three times although this isn't the only possibility. Here's one possibility:

Red-Blue-Yellow-Red-Blue-Yellow-Red-Blue-Yellow

Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Choose your shapes:** You've already selected circles and triangles.  Decide on their size and style (e.g. filled outlined different colors).  Consistency in size and style will make the pattern clearer.

2. **Determine the arrangement:**  The key is alternation. The simplest way is a linear pattern: circle triangle circle triangle circle triangle circle...  Continue this sequence until you've got at least five alternations.

3. **Draw it:**  Start by drawing the first shape (either a circle or a triangle). Then draw the next shape (the other one). Continue alternating until you reach at least five alternations.

4. **Consider variations:**  While a simple linear pattern works you can make it more interesting.  Some variations include:

    * **Arrangement:** Arrange the shapes in a row column spiral grid or other geometric formation.
    * **Size/Color:** Alternate not just the shapes but also their sizes or colors. For example large circle small triangle large circle small triangle etc.  Or use different colors for circles and triangles.
    * **Overlapping:** Make some shapes overlap others for a more complex visual effect.


**Example Linear Pattern:**

Let's say you choose to use filled red circles and filled blue triangles:

1. Red Circle
2. Blue Triangle
3. Red Circle
4. Blue Triangle
5. Red Circle
6. Blue Triangle


This fulfills the requirement of alternating at least five times.  You can continue beyond six if you want a longer pattern.  Remember to keep the size and style of your shapes consistent throughout the pattern for a cohesive look."

Since you only have two colors (let's call them A and B) the simplest repeating sequence is AB.

Therefore to create a three-section pattern with the same color order (AB) you would simply repeat the AB sequence three times:

**AB | AB | AB**

This fulfills all requirements:

* **Two colors:** A and B are used.
* **Three sections:** The pattern is clearly divided into three sections by the vertical bars.
* **Same color order:** Each section follows the AB sequence.

You can visually represent this in many ways depending on what you're making the pattern for.  For example:

* **Stripes:** Alternating stripes of color A and color B divided into three equal-length sets of stripes.
* **Squares:** A grid of squares where pairs of squares (A then B) are grouped into three sets.
* **Any other arrangement:** As long as the AB sequence is repeated three times in three distinct sections.


The solution is surprisingly straightforward once you understand the core requirement of repeating the same two-color sequence."

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","D","Plot the points (2 4) (3 6) (4 8) and (5 10) on a coordinate grid and identify the constant of proportionality.","Here's how to solve this task:

**1. Plotting the Points:**

* **Understand the Coordinate Grid:** A coordinate grid has a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis.  Points are represented by ordered pairs (x y) where 'x' is the horizontal position and 'y' is the vertical position.

* **Plot each point:**
    * (2 4): Go 2 units to the right on the x-axis then 4 units up on the y-axis.  Place a point there.
    * (3 6): Go 3 units to the right on the x-axis then 6 units up on the y-axis. Place a point.
    * (4 8): Go 4 units to the right 8 units up.
    * (5 10): Go 5 units to the right 10 units up.

**2. Identifying the Constant of Proportionality:**

A constant of proportionality exists when the relationship between x and y can be expressed as  y = kx where 'k' is the constant.  This means that y is always a multiple of x.  To find 'k' we can use any of the points:

* **Method 1: Using one point:** Choose any point (x y).  Then solve for k in the equation y = kx.

   Let's use (2 4):
   4 = k * 2
   k = 4 / 2
   k = 2

* **Method 2: Using multiple points (verification):** Check if the same 'k' value works for all points. If it does you've confirmed a proportional relationship.

   Let's check with (3 6):
   6 = k * 3
   k = 6 / 3
   k = 2

   And with (4 8):
    8 = k * 4
    k = 8 / 4
    k = 2

   And with (510):
    10 = k * 5
    k = 10 / 5
    k = 2

Since 'k' is consistently 2 for all points the constant of proportionality is 2.  This means that y is always twice the value of x.

**In summary:**  Plot the points as described in step 1.  Then using the equation y = kx and any of the points calculate the constant of proportionality (k) which in this case is 2.  You can verify this by checking if the same 'k' value works for all the other points.  The points when plotted will form a straight line passing through the origin (00) indicating a direct proportion."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","D","If a recipe requires 4 cups of flour to make 8 cookies graph the points (8 4) and (16 8) to represent the relationship and find the constant of proportionality.","This problem demonstrates a proportional relationship between the number of cookies and the amount of flour needed.  Let's break down how to solve it step-by-step:

**1. Understanding the Relationship:**

The recipe states that 4 cups of flour make 8 cookies. This can be expressed as a ratio: 4 cups/8 cookies.  This simplifies to 1/2 cup of flour per cookie.  This means the amount of flour is directly proportional to the number of cookies.

**2. Graphing the Points:**

* **(8 4):** This point represents 8 cookies requiring 4 cups of flour.  On a graph the x-axis (horizontal) would represent the number of cookies and the y-axis (vertical) would represent the cups of flour. So you'd plot a point at x=8 and y=4.

* **(16 8):** This point represents 16 cookies requiring 8 cups of flour (double the original recipe).  Plot this point at x=16 and y=8.

You should now have two points on your graph.  Since this is a proportional relationship these points will lie on a straight line that passes through the origin (00).

**3. Finding the Constant of Proportionality (k):**

The constant of proportionality (k) represents the rate of change – how many cups of flour are needed per cookie.  You can find it using either point:

* **Using (8 4):**  k = y/x = 4 cups / 8 cookies = 0.5 cups/cookie

* **Using (16 8):** k = y/x = 8 cups / 16 cookies = 0.5 cups/cookie

Both points give the same constant of proportionality: k = 0.5. This confirms the direct proportionality.  The equation representing this relationship is:  y = 0.5x  (where y is cups of flour and x is the number of cookies).


**In summary:** To solve this task you graph the given points observe that they form a straight line through the origin and calculate the constant of proportionality by dividing the amount of flour (y) by the number of cookies (x) for either point.  The constant of proportionality is 0.5 cups of flour per cookie."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","D","Write a proportional equation for the points (1 2) (2 4) (3 6) and then plot these points on a coordinate grid to visualize the relationship.","The task asks you to demonstrate a proportional relationship using these points.  Here's how to do it:

**1. Understanding Proportionality:**

A proportional relationship means that the ratio between the y-values and x-values remains constant.  In simpler terms as x increases y increases at a consistent rate.  This can be represented by the equation y = kx where 'k' is the constant of proportionality.

**2. Finding the Constant of Proportionality (k):**

Use any of the given points (x y) to solve for 'k'. Let's use (1 2):

* y = kx
* 2 = k * 1
* k = 2

Let's verify with another point (2 4):

* y = kx
* 4 = k * 2
* k = 2

Both points give the same value for k confirming a proportional relationship.  If you try the point (36) you will get k = 2 as well.

**3. Writing the Proportional Equation:**

Now that we know k = 2 we can write the proportional equation:

* y = 2x

**4. Plotting the Points:**

To visualize this on a coordinate grid:

* **x-axis:** Represents the x-values (1 2 3).
* **y-axis:** Represents the y-values (2 4 6).

Plot each point individually:

* (1 2): Go 1 unit to the right on the x-axis and 2 units up on the y-axis.
* (2 4): Go 2 units to the right on the x-axis and 4 units up on the y-axis.
* (3 6): Go 3 units to the right on the x-axis and 6 units up on the y-axis.

You'll notice that all three points lie on a straight line that passes through the origin (0 0). This is characteristic of a proportional relationship.  The line's slope will be equal to the constant of proportionality (k=2).


In summary:  The proportional equation is y = 2x. Plotting the points (12) (24) and (36) on a coordinate grid will show a straight line passing through the origin visually representing the proportional relationship."

* **Common ratio (r):** 0.5 (the value decreases by half each year)
* **Number of terms (n):** 4 (This includes the current year and the three following years).

**Method 1: Using a Ratio**

1. **Set up a ratio:**  The recipe states that 3 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies. This can be written as a ratio: 3 cups / 12 cookies.

2. **Create a proportion:** We want to find out how much flour (let's call it 'x' cups) is needed for 30 cookies.  So we set up a proportion:

   (3 cups / 12 cookies) = (x cups / 30 cookies)

3. **Solve for x:**  Cross-multiply:

   90 cups-cookies = 12x cups-cookies

4. **Isolate x:** Divide both sides by 12:

   x = 7.5 cups

Therefore you need 7.5 cups of flour for 30 cookies.


**Method 2: Find Flour per Cookie then Scale Up**

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Linear and other simple functions","D","Create a table of values for the linear function \(y = 3x + 2\) using the values of \(x\) from -2 to 2 and then graph the function on a coordinate plane.","To solve this task you need to perform two steps:

**Step 1: Create a table of values**

This involves substituting each x-value (-2 -1 0 1 2) into the equation  \(y = 3x + 2\) to find the corresponding y-value.

Here's how:

* **x = -2:**  y = 3(-2) + 2 = -6 + 2 = -4
* **x = -1:**  y = 3(-1) + 2 = -3 + 2 = -1
* **x = 0:**   y = 3(0) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2
* **x = 1:**   y = 3(1) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
* **x = 2:**   y = 3(2) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8

Now you can create your table:

| x   | y   |
|-----|-----|
| -2  | -4  |
| -1  | -1  |
| 0   | 2   |
| 1   | 5   |
| 2   | 8   |


**Step 2: Graph the function**

1. **Draw your axes:** Draw a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis intersecting at the origin (00).  Label your axes.

2. **Plot the points:** Use the table of values you created. Each row represents a point (x y) on the coordinate plane.  For example the first row (-2 -4) means you plot a point at x = -2 and y = -4. Plot all five points.

3. **Draw the line:** Since this is a linear function the points should all lie on a straight line. Use a ruler or straight edge to draw a line that passes through all five plotted points.  Extend the line beyond the plotted points to show that the function continues indefinitely.


That's it! You've successfully created a table of values and graphed the linear function \(y = 3x + 2\).  The graph will show a line that slopes upwards from left to right indicating a positive relationship between x and y.  The slope of the line is 3 and the y-intercept is 2 (where the line crosses the y-axis)."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Linear and other simple functions","D","A local bakery sells muffins for $2 each and cookies for $1.50 each; write a linear equation representing the total cost \(y\) for buying \(x\) muffins and then generate values for \(x\) from 0 to 4 to graph this equation.","The problem asks you to create a linear equation representing the cost of buying only muffins.  Let's break it down:

**1. Define the variables:**

*   `x`: Represents the number of muffins purchased.
*   `y`: Represents the total cost.

**2. Write the equation:**

Since each muffin costs $2 the total cost (y) is simply the number of muffins (x) multiplied by the price per muffin ($2).  Therefore the linear equation is:

`y = 2x`

**3. Generate values and create a table:**

To graph this equation we need to find the y-values (total cost) for different x-values (number of muffins) from 0 to 4.  Create a table like this:

| x (Number of Muffins) | y (Total Cost) |
|---|---|
| 0 | 2 * 0 = 0 |
| 1 | 2 * 1 = 2 |
| 2 | 2 * 2 = 4 |
| 3 | 2 * 3 = 6 |
| 4 | 2 * 4 = 8 |


**4. Graph the equation:**

Now plot these points (x y) on a graph. The x-axis represents the number of muffins and the y-axis represents the total cost.  Connect the points with a straight line as it's a linear equation. The line will start at the origin (00) and have a slope of 2 (meaning for every one muffin increase the cost increases by $2).


That's it! You've successfully created a linear equation representing the total cost of buying muffins and generated points to graph it.  The information about cookies is irrelevant to this specific task."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Linear and other simple functions","D","The temperature in degrees Fahrenheit can be estimated by the formula \(F = 9C + 32\) where \(C\) is the temperature in degrees Celsius; create a table of values for this relationship using Celsius values of 0 10 20 and 30 then plot the corresponding Fahrenheit values.","To solve this task you need to perform two main steps:  calculate the Fahrenheit equivalents and then plot the data.

**Step 1: Calculate Fahrenheit values**

The formula given is F = 9C + 32.  You'll substitute each Celsius value (0 10 20 30) into this formula to find the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature.

* **C = 0:** F = 9(0) + 32 = 32°F
* **C = 10:** F = 9(10) + 32 = 90 + 32 = 122°F
* **C = 20:** F = 9(20) + 32 = 180 + 32 = 212°F
* **C = 30:** F = 9(30) + 32 = 270 + 32 = 302°F

This gives you the following table:

| Celsius (C) | Fahrenheit (F) |
|---|---|
| 0 | 32 |
| 10 | 122 |
| 20 | 212 |
| 30 | 302 |


**Step 2: Plot the data**

Now create a graph with Celsius (C) on the horizontal (x) axis and Fahrenheit (F) on the vertical (y) axis.

1. **Label your axes:** Clearly label the x-axis as ""Celsius (°C)"" and the y-axis as ""Fahrenheit (°F)"".  Choose a scale that accommodates your data (e.g. increments of 10°C on the x-axis and 50°F or 100°F on the y-axis).

2. **Plot the points:**  For each row in your table plot a point on the graph. For example the first point will be at (0 32) the second at (10 122) and so on.

3. **Draw a line (optional):** Since this is a linear relationship (a straight line) you can draw a straight line connecting the points.  This line represents the formula F = 9C + 32.


Your completed graph will visually represent the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures based on the provided formula.  The line will show how Fahrenheit increases as Celsius increases."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Equations and algebra","F","Solve for x: 3(x - 4) = 2(x + 5).","The goal is to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation.  Here's how to solve 3(x - 4) = 2(x + 5):

1. **Distribute:**  First distribute the 3 on the left side and the 2 on the right side of the equation:

   3x - 12 = 2x + 10

2. **Combine like terms:**  Get all the 'x' terms on one side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other.  Let's subtract 2x from both sides:

   3x - 2x - 12 = 2x - 2x + 10

   This simplifies to:

   x - 12 = 10

3. **Isolate x:** Now add 12 to both sides to isolate 'x':

   x - 12 + 12 = 10 + 12

   This simplifies to:

   x = 22

Therefore the solution is **x = 22**"
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Equations and algebra","F","A school is planning a fundraiser; if the items cost $12 each and the total cost is equal to 4 times the number of items sold solve for y in the equation 12y = 4y + 48.","The equation 12y = 4y + 48 doesn't directly represent the problem description.  The problem states that the total cost (12y) is equal to four times the number of items sold (4y).  The ""+ 48"" is extra information not accounted for in the word problem.  Let's assume that ""+ 48"" represents some additional fixed cost (like a room rental fee for the fundraiser).

To solve the given equation 12y = 4y + 48:

1. **Subtract 4y from both sides:** This isolates the 'y' terms on one side of the equation.
   12y - 4y = 4y + 48 - 4y
   8y = 48

2. **Divide both sides by 8:** This solves for 'y'.
   8y / 8 = 48 / 8
   y = 6

Therefore y = 6.  This means 6 items need to be sold to cover the $48 fixed cost plus the item cost making the total cost equal to $12*6=$72. Note that 4 times the number of items sold (4*6 =24)  is not equal to the total cost. There's a mismatch between the equation and the problem description likely due to the ""+48"" representing a fixed cost not mentioned in the original word problem.

**To correctly model the word problem:** The equation should be 12y = 4y. This simplifies to 8y = 0 meaning y=0.  This indicates a flaw in the original word problem statement because the problem indicates there is a cost but it does not specify any revenue or profit goals.  It's not a well-defined scenario.

In short the equation given can be solved yielding y=6 but it doesn't accurately reflect the word problem description.  The word problem needs to be re-examined and clarified to create a consistent mathematical model."

Let's break down how it works and then solve it:

* **x represents the number of apples Alex has.**

* **2x represents the number of apples Jamie has** (twice as many as Alex).

* **2x + x represents the total number of apples they have together.**  This sum equals 36.

**Solving the equation:**

1. **Combine like terms:**  2x + x = 3x.  The equation becomes 3x = 36.

2. **Isolate x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

   3x / 3 = 36 / 3

   x = 12

Therefore **Alex has 12 apples**.  Jamie has twice that many or 2 * 12 = 24 apples.  Together they have 12 + 24 = 36 apples which matches the problem's statement."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Recognizing patterns and structures","G","A bakery produces 10 loaves of bread on the first day and increases production by 5 loaves each subsequent day; express the total number of loaves produced on day \( n \) as an algebraic formula and use it to find the number produced on day 7.","This problem describes an arithmetic sequence.  The key is understanding the pattern of bread production:

* **Day 1:** 10 loaves
* **Day 2:** 10 + 5 = 15 loaves
* **Day 3:** 15 + 5 = 20 loaves
* **Day 4:** 20 + 5 = 25 loaves
* and so on...

The general formula for the *nth* term (number of loaves produced on day n) of an arithmetic sequence is:

a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + (n - 1)d

Where:

* a<sub>n</sub> = the number of loaves on day n
* a<sub>1</sub> = the number of loaves on day 1 (10 in this case)
* n = the day number
* d = the common difference (the increase in loaves each day 5 in this case)


**1. Finding the algebraic formula:**

Substituting the values from the problem into the formula we get:

a<sub>n</sub> = 10 + (n - 1)5

This simplifies to:

a<sub>n</sub> = 10 + 5n - 5
a<sub>n</sub> = 5n + 5

This is the algebraic formula representing the total number of loaves produced on day 'n'.


**2. Finding the number produced on day 7:**

To find the number of loaves produced on day 7 substitute n = 7 into the formula:

a<sub>7</sub> = 5(7) + 5
a<sub>7</sub> = 35 + 5
a<sub>7</sub> = 40

Therefore the bakery produces 40 loaves of bread on day 7."

Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of family members.
* Let 'C' represent the total cost of the gym membership.

**2. Write the Algebraic Expression:**

The cost starts at $20 and increases by $5 for *each additional* member.  This means for each member beyond the first you add $5.  This can be expressed as:

C = 20 + 5(x - 1)

We subtract 1 from 'x' because the initial $20 covers the first member.

**3. Calculate the Cost for a Family of 4:**

Substitute x = 4 into the algebraic expression:

C = 20 + 5(4 - 1)
C = 20 + 5(3)
C = 20 + 15
C = $35

Therefore the total cost for a family of 4 is $35."

**1. Create the algebraic formula:**

* The base fee is a fixed cost of $30.  This will be a constant in our formula.
* The daily rental fee is $15 per day.  This will be multiplied by the number of days (`d`).

Therefore the total cost (C) can be represented by the following formula:

`C = 30 + 15d`

Where:

* `C` = Total cost
* `d` = Number of days the car is rented


**2. Determine the cost for renting the car for 3 days:**

Substitute `d = 3` into the formula:

`C = 30 + 15 * 3`
`C = 30 + 45`
`C = 75`

Therefore the cost for renting the car for 3 days is $75."
