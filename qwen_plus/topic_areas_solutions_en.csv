---

### Step 1: Understand the Task
- **Draw 10 stars**: You need to create 10 star shapes. A star typically has five points, but you can use any style of star that is clear and recognizable.
- **In the box**: This means all 10 stars should fit inside a defined rectangular area (the ""box"").
- **Color 5 of them blue**: After drawing the stars, you need to select exactly 5 of them and color them blue. The remaining 5 stars should remain uncolored or in their original color.

---

### Step 2: Gather Materials
- **Paper**: Use a clean sheet of paper to draw on.
- **Pencil/Marker/Pen**: To draw the stars and the box.
- **Blue Coloring Tool**: A blue marker, crayon, or colored pencil for coloring the stars.

---

### Step 3: Draw the Box
1. Use a ruler or straightedge to draw a rectangle on your paper. This will serve as the ""box"" where the stars will be placed.
2. Make sure the box is large enough to fit 10 stars comfortably without overcrowding.

---

### Step 4: Draw the Stars
1. Inside the box, draw 10 star shapes. Space them out evenly so they are easy to distinguish.
2. Ensure each star is roughly the same size and clearly recognizable as a star.

---

### Step 5: Color 5 Stars Blue
1. Choose 5 of the 10 stars to color blue. You can pick them randomly or follow a pattern (e.g., every other star, the first half, etc.).
2. Use your blue coloring tool to fill in the chosen stars completely. Make sure the blue color is vibrant and covers the entire star shape.

---

### Step 6: Review Your Work
1. Double-check that:
   - There are exactly 10 stars in the box.
   - Exactly 5 of those stars are colored blue.
   - The remaining 5 stars are not colored blue.

---

### Final Result
You now have a box containing 10 stars, with 5 of them colored blue. If you followed the steps correctly, your task is complete!

If you're working digitally (e.g., using software like Microsoft Paint, Adobe Illustrator, or similar tools), the process would involve creating the box and stars using digital drawing tools and selecting a blue fill for 5 of the stars. The principles remain the same.

This involves performing a subtraction operation.

Here’s how you can approach the task step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Liam starts with **347 marbles** and gives away **128 marbles**. The goal is to find out how many marbles he has remaining. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Remaining marbles} = \text{Initial marbles} - \text{Marbles given away}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Remaining marbles} = 347 - 128
\]

---

### Step 2: Perform the Subtraction
We now subtract \(128\) from \(347\). Let’s break it down:

#### Subtract the ones place:
- In the ones place, \(7 - 8\) cannot be done directly because \(7 < 8\). So, we borrow 1 from the tens place.
- Borrowing 1 from the tens place changes \(4\) in the tens place to \(3\), and the \(7\) in the ones place becomes \(17\).
- Now, \(17 - 8 = 9\).

#### Subtract the tens place:
- After borrowing, the tens place now has \(3\) instead of \(4\).
- Subtract \(3 - 2 = 1\) (since \(128\) has \(2\) in the tens place).

#### Subtract the hundreds place:
- Subtract \(3 - 1 = 2\) (since \(128\) has \(1\) in the hundreds place).

---

### Step 3: Write the Final Answer
Combining the results from each place value:
\[
347 - 128 = 219
\]

So, Liam has **219 marbles** left.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Sarah starts with **864 stickers** and loses **275 stickers**. The question asks us to find out how many stickers she still has. This is a subtraction problem because we are removing (losing) a certain number of stickers from her original collection.

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Subtraction
We write the problem as:
\[
864 - 275 = ?

---

### Step 3: Perform the Subtraction
We will subtract the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit (units place).

#### Step 3.1: Subtract the units place
The units digits are:
\[
4 - 5
\]
Since 4 is smaller than 5, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place. After borrowing, the 4 becomes 14, and we subtract:
\[
14 - 5 = 9
\]

#### Step 3.2: Subtract the tens place
After borrowing, the tens digit in 864 becomes 5 (instead of 6). Now subtract the tens digits:
\[
5 - 7
\]
Again, since 5 is smaller than 7, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place. After borrowing, the 5 becomes 15, and we subtract:
\[
15 - 7 = 8
\]

#### Step 3.3: Subtract the hundreds place
After borrowing, the hundreds digit in 864 becomes 7 (instead of 8). Now subtract the hundreds digits:
\[
7 - 2 = 5

### Known Information:
- The price of one pack of cookies is **$24**.
- The customer wants to buy **4 packs**.
- We need to calculate the total cost.

The distributive property states that for any numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[
a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)
\]

Here’s how we can apply this property to find the total cost:

---

### Step 1: Represent the total cost mathematically
The total cost of buying 4 packs of cookies at $24 each can be written as:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 4 \cdot 24
\]

---

### Step 2: Break down the number 24 using the distributive property
We can split 24 into two simpler numbers that are easier to work with. For example:
\[
24 = 20 + 4
\]

Now substitute this into the equation:
\[
4 \cdot 24 = 4 \cdot (20 + 4)
\]

Using the distributive property:
\[
4 \cdot (20 + 4) = (4 \cdot 20) + (4 \cdot 4)
\]

---

### Step 3: Perform the calculations
First, calculate \( 4 \cdot 20 \):
\[
4 \cdot 20 = 80
\]

Next, calculate \( 4 \cdot 4 \):
\[
4 \cdot 4 = 16
\]

Add these results together:
\[
80 + 16 = 96
\]

---

### Step 4: Write the final answer
The total cost of buying 4 packs of cookies is:
\[
\boxed{96}
\]

---

Breaking down the multiplication into smaller parts makes the calculation easier, especially if you're working without a calculator. This method also helps reinforce understanding of how numbers interact in arithmetic operations."
"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","If a box contains 36 chocolates and is divided equally into 4 smaller boxes how many chocolates will be in each box using the distributive property?","To solve this problem using the distributive property, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
You have a total of **36 chocolates** in one box. These chocolates are to be divided equally into **4 smaller boxes**. The goal is to determine how many chocolates will be in each smaller box.

The distributive property helps us understand division as repeated subtraction or grouping. It allows us to break down larger numbers into smaller parts to make calculations easier.

### Step 2: Represent the Division Mathematically
The division of 36 chocolates into 4 equal groups can be written as:
\[
36 \div 4
\]

This means we need to distribute 36 chocolates evenly across 4 smaller boxes.

### Step 3: Apply the Distributive Property
The distributive property states that dividing a number can be thought of as breaking it into smaller parts and then dividing those parts individually. For example:
\[
a \div b = (c + d) \div b = (c \div b) + (d \div b)
\]
Here, \(a\) is the total number being divided, \(b\) is the divisor, and \(c\) and \(d\) are parts of \(a\).

In our case:
\[
36 \div 4 = (32 + 4) \div 4 = (32 \div 4) + (4 \div 4)
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculations
Now, calculate each part separately:
- \(32 \div 4 = 8\)

"Numbers and operations","Understanding and performing operations","D","A gardener needs to plant 29 flowers in rows of 3; apply the distributive property to calculate the total number of flowers he needs to plant.","To solve this task using the distributive property, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
The gardener needs to plant **29 flowers in rows of 3**. This means that each row will contain 3 flowers, and we need to figure out how many rows are required to accommodate all 29 flowers.

The total number of flowers is already given as 29, so the task here is to use the **distributive property** to express and verify this calculation.

---

### Step 2: Express the problem mathematically
If the gardener plants flowers in rows of 3, the total number of flowers can be represented as:
\[
3 \cdot n + r = 29
\]
where:
- \( n \) is the number of complete rows,
- \( r \) is the remainder (extra flowers that don't form a full row).

Using division, we can determine:
\[
29 \div 3 = 9 \text{ remainder } 2
\]
This means there are **9 full rows** of 3 flowers each, and **2 extra flowers**.

---

### Step 3: Apply the distributive property
The distributive property states:
\[
a(b + c) = ab + ac
\]

Here, we can rewrite the total number of flowers (29) as:
\[
29 = (3 \cdot 9) + 2
\]

Breaking it down:
- \( 3 \cdot 9 = 27 \): This represents the flowers planted in 9 full rows.
- \( + 2 \): This represents the remaining 2 flowers that don't form a full row.

Thus, using the distributive property:
\[
29 = (3 \cdot 9) + 2
\]

---

### Step 4: Verify the result
To confirm:
\[
(3 \cdot 9) + 2 = 27 + 2 = 29
\]

This matches the total number of flowers the gardener needs to plant.

---

### Final Answer:
The gardener needs to plant **29 flowers**, which can be expressed using the distributive property as:
\[
\boxed{29 = (3 \cdot 9) + 2}

---

### Step 1: Understand what ""percent"" means
The term ""percent"" literally means ""per hundred."" So, when we say 85%, it means **85 out of 100**. This can be written as a fraction:
$$
85\% = \frac{85}{100}
$$

---

### Step 2: Simplify the fraction
To simplify a fraction, you need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator (85) and the denominator (100). Then divide both the numerator and denominator by their GCD.

#### Find the GCD of 85 and 100:
- The factors of 85 are: $1, 5, 17, 85$.
- The factors of 100 are: $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100$.
- The greatest common factor is $5$.

#### Divide both the numerator and denominator by 5:

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The original price of the shirt is **$45**, and it is on sale for **30% off**. This means you are paying only **70%** of the original price (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

We want to determine the **sale price** in decimal form.

---

### Step 2: Convert the Percentage to Decimal Form
Percentages can be converted to decimals by dividing them by 100. So:
- 30% as a decimal is \( \frac{30}{100} = 0.30 \).
- Similarly, 70% as a decimal is \( \frac{70}{100} = 0.70 \).

This means the sale price will be **70% (or 0.70)** of the original price.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Sale Price
To find the sale price, multiply the original price by the decimal equivalent of the percentage you are paying (70%, or 0.70):

\[
\text{Sale Price} = \text{Original Price} \times 0.70
\]

Substitute the original price (\$45) into the formula:

\[

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the initial position
The submarine is initially **150 meters below sea level**. In mathematical terms, this can be represented as **-150 meters**, where negative values indicate depth below sea level.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the movement
The submarine rises by **75 meters**. Rising means moving upward, which reduces the depth. Mathematically, this is equivalent to adding **+75 meters** to the current depth.

---

### Step 3: Perform the calculation
We now calculate the new depth by adding the rise (75 meters) to the initial depth (-150 meters):

\[
\text{New Depth} = -150 + 75
\]

Perform the addition:

\[
-150 + 75 = -75

Let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The climber starts at sea level (elevation = 0 meters). She first ascends **200 meters**, which increases her elevation. Then, she descends **50 meters**, which decreases her elevation. We need to determine her final elevation relative to sea level.

---

### Step 2: Represent the Movements Mathematically
- Ascending 200 meters means adding +200 meters to her starting elevation.
- Descending 50 meters means subtracting -50 meters from her current elevation.

Thus, her final elevation can be calculated as:
$$
\text{Final Elevation} = \text{Starting Elevation} + \text{Net Change in Elevation}
$$

Here:
- Starting Elevation = 0 meters (sea level)
- Net Change in Elevation = $+200 \, \text{meters} - 50 \, \text{meters}$

---

### Step 3: Perform the Calculation
Now, compute the net change in elevation:
$$
\text{Net Change in Elevation} = 200 - 50 = 150 \, \text{meters}
$$

Add this net change to the starting elevation:
$$
\text{Final Elevation} = 0 + 150 = 150 \, \text{meters}
$$

---

### Step 4: Interpret the Result
The climber's final elevation is **150 meters above sea level**. This is also her **final elevation change** because she started at sea level.

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, etc., are prime numbers.

Now, check each factor of 36 to see if it is a prime number:
- \(1\): Not a prime number (prime numbers must be greater than 1).
- \(2\): Prime number (divisible only by 1 and 2).
- \(3\): Prime number (divisible only by 1 and 3).
- \(4\): Not a prime number (divisible by 1, 2, and 4).
- \(6\): Not a prime number (divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6).
- \(9\): Not a prime number (divisible by 1, 3, and 9).
- \(12\): Not a prime number (divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12).
- \(18\): Not a prime number (divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18).
- \(36\): Not a prime number (divisible by many numbers, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36).

From this analysis, the prime factors of 36 are:
\[
2 \text{ and } 3
\]

---

### **Step 4: Final Answer**
The factors of 36 are:
\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36

---

### Step 1: Understanding Multiples
A **multiple** of a number is the result of multiplying that number by an integer. For example, the multiples of 7 are obtained by multiplying 7 by integers such as 1, 2, 3, etc.

---

### Step 2: Calculating the First Five Multiples of 7
We calculate the first five multiples of 7 by multiplying 7 with the integers 1 through 5:

1. \( 7 \times 1 = 7 \)
2. \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \)
3. \( 7 \times 3 = 21 \)
4. \( 7 \times 4 = 28 \)
5. \( 7 \times 5 = 35 \)

Thus, the first five multiples of 7 are:
\[
7, 14, 21, 28, 35
\]

---

### Step 3: Observing the Pattern
Now, let's analyze the pattern in these multiples:

1. **Constant Difference**: Each multiple increases by 7 compared to the previous one. This is because we are adding 7 repeatedly:
   - \( 14 - 7 = 7 \)
   - \( 21 - 14 = 7 \)
   - \( 28 - 21 = 7 \)
   - \( 35 - 28 = 7 \)

   This constant difference of 7 indicates that the sequence of multiples forms an **arithmetic progression** with a common difference of 7.

2. **Divisibility by 7**: All the numbers in this sequence are divisible by 7 without leaving a remainder. This is a defining property of multiples.

3. **Last Digit Pattern**: If we look at the last digits of the multiples:
   - \( 7 \): Last digit is 7
   - \( 14 \): Last digit is 4
   - \( 21 \): Last digit is 1
   - \( 28 \): Last digit is 8
   - \( 35 \): Last digit is 5

   The last digits repeat in a cycle: \( 7, 4, 1, 8, 5 \). This repeating pattern occurs because we are adding 7 repeatedly, and the last digit resets after every 10 numbers.

---

### Step 4: Generalizing the Pattern
The \( n \)-th multiple of 7 can be expressed mathematically as:
\[
7n
\]
where \( n \) is a positive integer. Using this formula, you can find any multiple of 7 by substituting the desired value of \( n \).

---

### Final Answer
The first five multiples of 7 are:
\[
\boxed{7, 14, 21, 28, 35}
\]

The pattern observed is:
1. A constant difference of 7 between consecutive multiples.
2. All multiples are divisible by 7.
3. The last digits follow a repeating cycle: \( 7, 4, 1, 8, 5 \)."
"Numbers and operations","Expanding number relationships and number spaces","E","If you have 48 apples and want to divide them equally into baskets determine all the possible numbers of baskets you can use by finding the factors of 48.","To solve this task, you need to determine all the possible numbers of baskets into which 48 apples can be divided equally. This involves finding all the factors of 48, as each factor represents a possible number of baskets.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand what a factor is
A factor of a number is any integer that divides the number evenly (without leaving a remainder). For example, if \( n \) is a factor of 48, then \( 48 \div n \) will result in an integer.

#### Step 2: List all the factors of 48
To find all the factors of 48, start by checking which integers from 1 up to 48 divide 48 without leaving a remainder. A systematic way to do this is:

1. Start with 1 and check divisibility:
   - \( 48 \div 1 = 48 \), so 1 and 48 are factors.
   
2. Check the next integer, 2:
   - \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \), so 2 and 24 are factors.
   
3. Check the next integer, 3:
   - \( 48 \div 3 = 16 \), so 3 and 16 are factors.
   
4. Check the next integer, 4:
   - \( 48 \div 4 = 12 \), so 4 and 12 are factors.
   
5. Check the next integer, 5:
   - \( 48 \div 5 = 9.6 \), so 5 is not a factor.
   
6. Check the next integer, 6:
   - \( 48 \div 6 = 8 \), so 6 and 8 are factors.
   
7. Stop when you reach the square root of 48 (approximately 6.93), because after this point, you will just repeat the factors in reverse order.

#### Step 3: Compile the list of factors
From the above steps, the factors of 48 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48 \]

#### Step 4: Interpret the results
Each factor represents a possible number of baskets into which the 48 apples can be divided equally. For example:
- If you use 1 basket, there will be 48 apples in it.
- If you use 2 baskets, there will be 24 apples in each basket.
- If you use 3 baskets, there will be 16 apples in each basket.
- And so on...

#### Final Answer:
The possible numbers of baskets are:
\[
\boxed{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48}

The LCM is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of both numbers.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The task is to find how often the multiples of 8 and 12 coincide. This happens at their common multiples, and the smallest such multiple is the LCM.

For example:
- Multiples of 8: \( 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, \dots \)
- Multiples of 12: \( 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, \dots \)

The first common multiple here is **24**, which is the LCM of 8 and 12.

---

### Step 2: Use Prime Factorization
Prime factorization helps us determine the LCM systematically.

#### Prime factorization of 8:
\( 8 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^3 \)

#### Prime factorization of 12:
\( 12 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 2^2 \times 3 \)

---

### Step 3: Identify the Highest Powers of All Prime Factors
To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the factorizations:

- For the prime factor \( 2 \), the highest power is \( 2^3 \) (from 8).
- For the prime factor \( 3 \), the highest power is \( 3^1 \) (from 12).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[
\text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^1 = 8 \times 3 = 24
\]

---

### Step 4: Verify the Result
Check if 24 is a multiple of both 8 and 12:
- \( 24 \div 8 = 3 \) (an integer, so 24 is a multiple of 8)
- \( 24 \div 12 = 2 \) (an integer, so 24 is a multiple of 12)

Since 24 is the smallest such number, it is indeed the LCM.

---

### Final Answer:
The least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 12 is **24**. This means the multiples of 8 and 12 will coincide every 24 units.

Below, I will explain two common approaches: **Prime Factorization** and the **Euclidean Algorithm**.

---

### **1. Prime Factorization Method**
This method involves breaking down each number into its prime factors and identifying the common factors.

#### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Find the prime factorization of 20:**
   - Start dividing 20 by the smallest prime number, 2: \( 20 \div 2 = 10 \).
   - Divide 10 by 2 again: \( 10 \div 2 = 5 \).
   - Finally, divide 5 by the next prime number, 5: \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \).
   - So, the prime factorization of 20 is: \( 2^2 \cdot 5 \).

2. **Find the prime factorization of 30:**
   - Start dividing 30 by the smallest prime number, 2: \( 30 \div 2 = 15 \).
   - Divide 15 by the next prime number, 3: \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \).
   - Finally, divide 5 by the next prime number, 5: \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \).
   - So, the prime factorization of 30 is: \( 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \).

3. **Identify the common prime factors:**
   - The prime factors of 20 are \( 2^2 \cdot 5 \).
   - The prime factors of 30 are \( 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \).
   - The common prime factors are \( 2 \) and \( 5 \).

4. **Multiply the common prime factors with the lowest powers:**
   - For \( 2 \), the lowest power is \( 2^1 \).
   - For \( 5 \), the lowest power is \( 5^1 \).
   - Therefore, the GCD is \( 2^1 \cdot 5^1 = 10 \).

---

### **2. Euclidean Algorithm**
This method uses repeated division to find the GCD. It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.

#### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Start with the two numbers:**
   - Let \( a = 30 \) (the larger number) and \( b = 20 \) (the smaller number).

2. **Divide \( a \) by \( b \) and find the remainder:**
   - Perform \( 30 \div 20 \). The quotient is \( 1 \) and the remainder is \( 10 \) (since \( 30 - 20 \cdot 1 = 10 \)).

3. **Replace \( a \) with \( b \) and \( b \) with the remainder:**
   - Now, let \( a = 20 \) and \( b = 10 \).

4. **Repeat the process until the remainder is 0:**
   - Perform \( 20 \div 10 \). The quotient is \( 2 \) and the remainder is \( 0 \) (since \( 20 - 10 \cdot 2 = 0 \)).
   - When the remainder becomes \( 0 \), the current value of \( b \) is the GCD.

5. **The GCD is the last non-zero remainder:**
   - Here, the last non-zero remainder is \( 10 \).

### **Final Answer:**
Using either method, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 30 is:

The LCM will help us find the smallest number of flowers that can be evenly divided into rows using both red and blue flowers without any leftovers.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Understand the Problem:
The gardener has:
- 18 red flowers
- 24 blue flowers

We want to find the smallest total number of flowers such that the flowers can be arranged in rows where each row contains the same number of flowers, with no leftovers for either color.

This requires finding the LCM of 18 and 24.

---

#### 2. Recall the Definition of LCM:
The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.

---

#### 3. Find the Prime Factorization of Each Number:
To compute the LCM, start by breaking down each number into its prime factors:
- \( 18 = 2 \times 3^2 \)
- \( 24 = 2^3 \times 3 \)

---

#### 4. Identify the Highest Powers of All Prime Factors:
The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the factorizations:
- For \( 2 \): The highest power is \( 2^3 \) (from 24).
- For \( 3 \): The highest power is \( 3^2 \) (from 18).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[
\text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^2 = 8 \times 9 = 72
\]

---

#### 5. Interpret the Result:
The LCM of 18 and 24 is **72**. This means the smallest number of flowers the gardener can use is 72, ensuring that both red and blue flowers can be evenly divided into rows.

---

#### 6. Verify the Solution:
- Check if 72 is divisible by 18: \( 72 \div 18 = 4 \) (no remainder).
- Check if 72 is divisible by 24: \( 72 \div 24 = 3 \) (no remainder).

Since 72 satisfies these conditions, it is indeed the smallest number of flowers the gardener can use.

---

### Final Answer:
The smallest number of total flowers the gardener can use without having leftovers is:

Here's how you can approach it:

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem
The task involves two main operations:
1. **Exponentiation**: Calculate \( 3^4 \), which means multiplying \( 3 \) by itself four times.
2. **Subtraction**: Subtract the square root of \( 64 \) from the result of \( 3^4 \).

---

### Step 2: Perform the calculations step-by-step

#### Part 1: Calculate \( 3^4 \)
The expression \( 3^4 \) means:
\[
3^4 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3
\]
First, calculate \( 3 \times 3 \):
\[
3 \times 3 = 9
\]
Next, multiply \( 9 \times 3 \):
\[
9 \times 3 = 27
\]
Finally, multiply \( 27 \times 3 \):
\[
27 \times 3 = 81
\]
So, \( 3^4 = 81 \).

---

#### Part 2: Calculate the square root of \( 64 \)
The square root of \( 64 \) is the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals \( 64 \). Since:
\[
8 \times 8 = 64
\]
we know that:
\[
\sqrt{64} = 8
\]

---

#### Part 3: Subtract the square root of \( 64 \) from \( 3^4 \)

---

### Step 1: Understand the components of the problem
The problem involves two main operations:
1. **Finding the square root of 49**: The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.
2. **Raising 2 to the power of 5**: This means multiplying 2 by itself 5 times.

### Step 1: Understand the scale
The scale of 1:250 means that **1 unit of length on the model represents 250 units of the same length in reality**. In other words, if the actual skyscraper is 300 meters tall, the height of the model will be 1/250th of that.

---

### Step 2: Convert the actual height into centimeters
Since we want the final answer in centimeters, let's first convert the actual height of the skyscraper from meters to centimeters:
- 1 meter = 100 centimeters.
- Therefore, the actual height of the skyscraper is:
  $$
  300 \, \text{meters} \times 100 = 30,000 \, \text{centimeters}.
  $$

---

### Step 3: Apply the scale factor
The model is built at a scale of 1:250, meaning the height of the model is 1/250th of the actual height. To find the height of the model, divide the actual height (in centimeters) by 250:
$$
\text{Height of the model} = \frac{\text{Actual height}}{\text{Scale factor}} = \frac{30,000}{250}.

### Step 1: Understand the given ratio
The recipe specifies that **3 cups of flour are needed for every 2 cups of sugar**. This means the ratio of flour to sugar is:

\[
\text{Flour : Sugar} = 3 : 2
\]

This ratio tells us that for every 3 parts of flour, there are 2 parts of sugar.

---

### Step 2: Determine how much flour the baker wants to use
The baker plans to use **6 cups of flour** instead of the original 3 cups. To maintain the same ratio of flour to sugar, we need to calculate how much sugar corresponds to 6 cups of flour.

---

### Step 3: Set up a proportion
Since the ratio of flour to sugar is \(3 : 2\), we can set up a proportion to find the amount of sugar needed when using 6 cups of flour:

\[
\frac{\text{Flour}}{\text{Sugar}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Substitute the known value of flour (6 cups) into the proportion:

\[
\frac{6}{\text{Sugar}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Let \(x\) represent the amount of sugar needed. The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{6}{x} = \frac{3}{2}

\[
6 \cdot 2 = 3 \cdot x
\]

\[
12 = 3x
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = \frac{12}{3} = 4

Here's how you can approach the problem step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The goal is to calculate the remaining amount after subtracting the amount spent from the amount raised. However, instead of finding the exact answer, you are asked to **estimate** the result by rounding both numbers to the nearest ten.

---

### Step 2: Round Each Number to the Nearest Ten
- **Round $1248 to the nearest ten:**  
  Look at the ones digit (8). Since 8 is greater than or equal to 5, round up.  
  $1248 rounded to the nearest ten is **$1250**.

- **Round $673 to the nearest ten:**  
  Look at the ones digit (3). Since 3 is less than 5, round down.  
  $673 rounded to the nearest ten is **$670**.

---

### Step 3: Subtract the Rounded Numbers
Now subtract the rounded amount spent from the rounded amount raised:
$$
1250 - 670 = 580
$$

---

### Step 4: Verify the Reasonableness of the Estimate
The estimated result is **$580**, which is close to the exact result if you were to calculate it without rounding:
$$
1248 - 673 = 575
$$
The estimate ($580) is very close to the actual value ($575), so it is reasonable.

---

### Final Answer:
The estimated total amount left, after rounding to the nearest ten, is **$\boxed{580}$**."
"Numbers and operations","Applying calculation strategies","E","Jenna has \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza and her friend gives her \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a pizza; how much pizza does Jenna have now?","To solve this problem, we need to add the fractions \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\) to determine how much pizza Jenna has in total. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Jenna starts with \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza, and her friend gives her \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a pizza. To find the total amount of pizza Jenna has, we need to compute:
\[
\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

---

### Step 2: Find a Common Denominator
To add fractions, the denominators must be the same. The denominators here are \(3\) and \(4\). The least common denominator (LCD) of \(3\) and \(4\) is \(12\), because \(12\) is the smallest number divisible by both \(3\) and \(4\).

---

### Step 3: Rewrite Each Fraction with the Common Denominator
We rewrite each fraction so that they have the denominator \(12\):

1. For \(\frac{2}{3}\):
   - Multiply both the numerator and denominator by \(4\) (since \(3 \times 4 = 12\)):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{8}{12}
   \]

2. For \(\frac{1}{4}\):
   - Multiply both the numerator and denominator by \(3\) (since \(4 \times 3 = 12\)):
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{3}{12}
   \]

Now the fractions are \(\frac{8}{12}\) and \(\frac{3}{12}\).

---

### Step 4: Add the Fractions
Since the denominators are now the same, we can simply add the numerators:
\[
\frac{8}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{8 + 3}{12} = \frac{11}{12}
\]

---

### Step 5: Simplify the Result (if necessary)
The fraction \(\frac{11}{12}\) is already in its simplest form because \(11\) and \(12\) have no common factors other than \(1\).

---

### Final Answer:
Jenna now has \(\boxed{\frac{11}{12}}\) of a pizza."

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Jerry requires \(\frac{5}{6}\) cup of sugar for the recipe, but he currently has \(\frac{1}{3}\) cup. To find out how much more sugar he needs, we subtract the amount he already has (\(\frac{1}{3}\)) from the total required (\(\frac{5}{6}\)).

This can be written as:
\[
\text{Sugar needed} = \frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{3}
\]

---

### Step 2: Find a Common Denominator
To subtract fractions, they must have the same denominator. The denominators here are \(6\) and \(3\). The least common denominator (LCD) of \(6\) and \(3\) is \(6\).

- The fraction \(\frac{5}{6}\) already has a denominator of \(6\), so it remains unchanged.
- For \(\frac{1}{3}\), we rewrite it with a denominator of \(6\):
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 2}{3 \times 2} = \frac{2}{6}
  \]

Now the subtraction becomes:
\[
\frac{5}{6} - \frac{2}{6}
\]

---

### Step 3: Subtract the Fractions
Since the denominators are now the same, subtract the numerators:
\[
\frac{5}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5 - 2}{6} = \frac{3}{6}
\]

---

### Step 4: Simplify the Result
The fraction \(\frac{3}{6}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is \(3\):
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{3 \div 3}{6 \div 3} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Jerry needs to gather \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\) cup more sugar to meet the recipe's requirement."
"Numbers and operations","Applying calculation strategies","E","During a fundraiser Emily read \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a book and later she read another \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the book; what fraction of the book has she read in total?","To solve this problem, we need to determine the total fraction of the book Emily has read by adding the two fractions she read during the fundraiser. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Emily read:
- \(\frac{3}{8}\) of the book initially.
- \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the book later.

We want to find the **total fraction** of the book she has read, which is the sum of these two fractions:
\[
\text{Total fraction read} = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{2}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Find a Common Denominator
To add fractions, their denominators must be the same. The denominators here are \(8\) and \(2\). The least common denominator (LCD) of \(8\) and \(2\) is \(8\).

Now, rewrite each fraction with the denominator \(8\):
- \(\frac{3}{8}\) already has a denominator of \(8\), so it remains \(\frac{3}{8}\).
- To rewrite \(\frac{1}{2}\) with a denominator of \(8\), multiply both the numerator and denominator by \(4\):
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 4}{2 \times 4} = \frac{4}{8}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Add the Fractions
Now that both fractions have the same denominator (\(8\)), we can add them directly:
\[
\frac{3}{8} + \frac{4}{8} = \frac{3 + 4}{8} = \frac{7}{8}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Simplify the Result
The fraction \(\frac{7}{8}\) is already in its simplest form because \(7\) and \(8\) have no common factors other than \(1\).

---

### Final Answer:
Emily has read a total of \(\boxed{\frac{7}{8}}\) of the book."
"Numbers and operations","Applying calculation strategies","F","A store is having a sale where all items are 15% off; estimate the total cost of buying 3 shirts priced at $25 each and 2 pairs of shoes priced at $40 each after applying the discount.","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total cost of the items after applying the 15% discount. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach the problem:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost before the discount
First, determine the total cost of the shirts and shoes before applying the discount.

- **Cost of shirts**: Each shirt costs $25, and you are buying 3 shirts.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of shirts} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

- **Cost of shoes**: Each pair of shoes costs $40, and you are buying 2 pairs.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of shoes} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

- **Total cost before discount**:
  \[
  \text{Total cost before discount} = 75 + 80 = 155 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the discount amount
The store is offering a 15% discount on all items. To find the discount amount, multiply the total cost before the discount by 15%.

\[
\text{Discount amount} = 155 \times 0.15 = 23.25 \, \text{dollars}
\]

---

### Step 3: Subtract the discount from the total cost
Now, subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount to find the final total cost.

\[
\text{Total cost after discount} = 155 - 23.25 = 131.75 \, \text{dollars}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The estimated total cost of buying 3 shirts and 2 pairs of shoes after applying the 15% discount is **$\boxed{131.75}$** dollars."

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The recipe specifies the amounts of milk, yogurt, and fruit in cups. You are asked to:
1. Round each ingredient amount to the nearest whole number.
2. Estimate the total volume by summing up the rounded values.

---

### Step 2: Round Each Ingredient Amount
Rounding involves determining whether a number is closer to the lower or higher whole number.

- **Milk**: The amount is 2.5 cups.  
  Since 2.5 is exactly halfway between 2 and 3, we round it **up** to **3** cups (the standard rule is to round up when the decimal part is 0.5 or higher).

- **Yogurt**: The amount is 1.3 cups.  
  Since 1.3 is closer to 1 than to 2, we round it **down** to **1** cup.

- **Fruit**: The amount is 0.75 cups.  
  Since 0.75 is closer to 1 than to 0, we round it **up** to **1** cup.

---

### Step 3: Add the Rounded Values
Now, add the rounded amounts together to estimate the total volume:
$$
\text{Total Volume} = \text{Rounded Milk} + \text{Rounded Yogurt} + \text{Rounded Fruit}
$$
$$
\text{Total Volume} = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \, \text{cups}

Additionally, you need to calculate how much money will remain after buying the tickets. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Divide the total amount of money by the cost of one ticket
You start with $250 and each ticket costs $67. To estimate how many tickets you can buy, divide $250 by $67:

$$
\frac{250}{67} \approx 3.73
$$

This division tells you that you can afford **approximately 3.73 tickets**. Since you cannot buy a fraction of a ticket, you round down to the nearest whole number, which is **3 tickets**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the tickets you can buy
Now that you know you can buy 3 tickets, multiply the number of tickets by the cost per ticket to find out how much money you will spend:

$$
3 \times 67 = 201
$$

So, the total cost for 3 tickets is **$201**.

---

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost from your initial amount
To find out how much money you will have left over, subtract the total cost of the tickets ($201) from your initial amount of money ($250):

$$
250 - 201 = 49
$$

Thus, you will have **$49** remaining after purchasing 3 tickets.

---

### Final Answer:
- You can buy **3 tickets**.
- You will have **$49 left over**.

$$
\boxed{\text{3 tickets, $49 left}}

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- The bakery sells cookies at **$2.50 each**.
- For orders of a **dozen (12 cookies)**, there is a **15% discount** on the total cost.
- We need to calculate the total cost after the discount for **two dozen cookies**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost without the discount
First, determine the cost of two dozen cookies without any discount:
- One dozen = 12 cookies.
- Two dozen = \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) cookies.
- Cost per cookie = $2.50.

The total cost without the discount is:
\[
24 \times 2.50 = 60.00 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Apply the 15% discount
Since the bakery offers a 15% discount for orders of a dozen or more, we apply the discount to the total cost:
- The discount amount is \( 15\% \) of $60.00:
\[
\text{Discount} = 60.00 \times 0.15 = 9.00 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

Subtract the discount from the original cost:
\[
\text{Total cost after discount} = 60.00 - 9.00 = 51.00 \, \text{dollars}.

Let's break this down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- The test has **60 questions** in total.
- The student scored **85%** on the test.
- The student got **15 questions wrong**.

We aim to:
1. Calculate the number of correct answers based on the number of wrong answers.
2. Verify if the percentage corresponding to the calculated number of correct answers matches the given score of 85%.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of correct answers
If the student got **15 questions wrong**, the number of correct answers can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Number of correct answers} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Number of wrong answers}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Number of correct answers} = 60 - 15 = 45
\]

So, the student answered **45 questions correctly**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage score
The percentage score is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Percentage score} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of correct answers}}{\text{Total questions}} \right) \times 100
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Percentage score} = \left( \frac{45}{60} \right) \times 100 = 75\%
\]

---

### Step 4: Compare with the given score
The calculated percentage score is **75%**, but the problem states that the student scored **85%**. This discrepancy indicates that either:
1. The given percentage (85%) is incorrect, or
2. The information about the number of wrong answers (15) is incorrect.

---

### Final Conclusion
Based on the provided data:
- If the student got **15 questions wrong**, their score should be **75%**, not **85%**.
- To achieve an 85% score, the student would need to answer:
\[
\text{Correct answers for 85%} = \left( \frac{85}{100} \right) \times 60 = 51 \text{ questions correctly}.
\]
This means the student could only have gotten:
\[
\text{Wrong answers for 85%} = 60 - 51 = 9 \text{ questions wrong}.
\]

Thus, the given score of 85% is inconsistent with the claim of 15 wrong answers.

"Numbers and operations","Applying calculation strategies","H","During a sale a pair of shoes originally priced at $80 is marked down by 25% and then an additional 10% off the sale price is applied; find the final price of the shoes after both discounts.","To solve the problem of finding the final price of the shoes after both discounts, let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the original price and the first discount
The original price of the shoes is **$80**. The first discount is **25% off**.

- A **25% discount** means you are reducing the price by 25% of the original price.
- To calculate the amount of the discount:
  \[
  \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage}
  \]
  Substituting the values:
  \[
  \text{Discount Amount} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20
  \]

- Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price after the first discount:
  \[
  \text{Sale Price After First Discount} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
  \]
  Substituting the values:
  \[
  \text{Sale Price After First Discount} = 80 - 20 = 60
  \]

So, after the first discount, the price of the shoes is **$60**.

---

### Step 2: Apply the second discount
The second discount is **10% off** the sale price after the first discount.

- A **10% discount** means you are reducing the price by 10% of the current sale price ($60).
- To calculate the amount of the second discount:
  \[
  \text{Second Discount Amount} = \text{Sale Price After First Discount} \times \text{Discount Percentage}
  \]
  Substituting the values:
  \[
  \text{Second Discount Amount} = 60 \times 0.10 = 6
  \]

- Subtract the second discount amount from the sale price after the first discount to find the final price:
  \[
  \text{Final Price} = \text{Sale Price After First Discount} - \text{Second Discount Amount}
  \]
  Substituting the values:
  \[
  \text{Final Price} = 60 - 6 = 54
  \]

---

### Final Answer:
The final price of the shoes after both discounts is **$\boxed{54}$** dollars.

This process will guide you through planning and executing the drawing:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Task**
The task requires:
- A **cat** sitting below a tree.
- A **bird** located beside the tree.

This means the composition should clearly show the relationship between the three elements: the cat, the tree, and the bird. The cat is positioned under the tree, while the bird is near the tree but not necessarily on it.

---

### **Step 2: Gather Materials**
Ensure you have the necessary tools for drawing:
- Paper or a digital canvas.
- Pencils, pens, markers, or digital drawing software (e.g., Procreate, Photoshop).
- Eraser (if using traditional media).

---

### **Step 3: Plan the Composition**
Before starting to draw, think about how the elements will be arranged:
1. Decide where the **tree** will be placed in the picture. It could be centered or slightly off-center.
2. Place the **cat** underneath the tree, ensuring it looks like it's sitting or resting.
3. Position the **bird** beside the tree. The bird could be on the ground, flying low, or perched on a branch near the base of the tree.

---

### **Step 4: Sketch the Basic Shapes**
Start with light outlines to establish the structure of your drawing:
1. Draw the **tree**:
   - Begin with a simple trunk (a vertical rectangle or cylinder shape).
   - Add branches extending from the trunk.
   - Sketch the canopy of the tree as an oval or cloud-like shape.
2. Draw the **cat**:
   - Place the cat at the base of the tree.
   - Use basic shapes: an oval for the body, circles for the head, and lines for the legs.
3. Draw the **bird**:
   - Position the bird beside the tree.
   - Use an oval for the body, a smaller circle for the head, and a triangle for the beak.

---

### **Step 5: Refine the Details**
Once the basic shapes are in place, add details to make the drawing more realistic:
1. **Tree**:
   - Add texture to the trunk (bark patterns).
   - Include leaves in the canopy, either as individual leaves or clusters.
2. **Cat**:
   - Define the facial features (eyes, nose, whiskers).
   - Add fur texture and refine the shape of the legs and tail.
3. **Bird**:
   - Add feathers to the wings and tail.
   - Define the eye and beak.

---

### **Step 6: Add Shading and Color**
Enhance the drawing by adding shading and color:
1. Use shading to create depth:
   - Darken areas under the tree canopy to suggest shadows.
   - Add shadows to the cat and bird to make them appear grounded.
2. Apply color:
   - Use green for the tree leaves and brown for the trunk.
   - Choose a color for the cat (e.g., orange, gray, black).
   - Color the bird appropriately (e.g., blue, red, yellow).

---

### **Step 7: Finalize the Drawing**
Review your work and make any final adjustments:
- Ensure the proportions of the cat, tree, and bird are balanced.
- Check that the relationships between the elements are clear (cat below the tree, bird beside it).
- Clean up any unnecessary lines or smudges.

---

### **Optional: Add Background**
If desired, enhance the scene by adding a background:
- Draw grass or flowers around the base of the tree.
- Include a sky with clouds or a sun in the background.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Understand the Task
The goal is to determine which object among the three (lamp, chair, or book) is positioned **above** the table in the picture. ""Above"" means directly over the table, at a higher level, and not on the surface of the table.

### Step 2: Examine the Picture
Carefully look at the image provided. Pay attention to the placement of each object relative to the table:
- Is the **lamp** hanging above the table, sitting on the table, or elsewhere in the room?
- Is the **chair** placed near the table, under the table, or somewhere else entirely?
- Is the **book** lying on the table, floating above it, or located elsewhere?

### Step 3: Eliminate Objects That Don’t Fit
- If an object is **on the table**, it is not ""above"" the table—it is part of the table's surface.
- If an object is **next to the table** or below it, it also does not meet the criteria for being ""above.""

### Step 4: Identify the Correct Object
Based on your observation:
- If the **lamp** is hanging from the ceiling directly over the table, then it is the correct answer.
- If the **chair** is positioned under the table or beside it, it cannot be ""above"" the table.
- If the **book** is floating above the table (which is rare but possible in some illustrations), it could be the correct answer.

### Step 5: Circle the Correct Answer
Once you’ve determined which object is truly above the table, circle it confidently.

---

### Example Analysis:
Let’s assume the following scenario based on typical arrangements:
- The **lamp** is hanging from the ceiling above the table.
- The **chair** is sitting beside the table.
- The **book** is resting on the table.

In this case, the **lamp** would be the correct answer because it is the only object explicitly above the table.

Here’s how you can approach it step by step:

### Step 1: Observe or Imagine the Scene
- Visualize or analyze the situation. Is the dog located:
  - **In front of** the house (on the side where the entrance is typically found)?
  - **Behind** the house (on the opposite side from the front)?
  - **Beside** the house (to the left or right of it)?

### Step 2: Identify Key Information
- Look for clues in any provided details, such as:
  - A description of the dog's location.
  - Any landmarks or directions mentioned.
  - Diagrams or images showing the layout.

For example:
- If the problem says, ""The dog is near the backyard,"" the dog is likely **behind** the house.
- If it mentions, ""The dog is waiting by the front door,"" the dog is **in front of** the house.
- If it states, ""The dog is resting under the tree next to the garage,"" the dog might be **beside** the house.

#### Examples:
- The dog is **in front of** the house.
- The dog is **behind** the house.
- The dog is **beside** the house.

### Step 4: Double-Check Your Answer
Ensure your sentence accurately reflects the information given and uses proper grammar.

---

If no specific details are provided, you could make an assumption based on common scenarios. For instance:
- If nothing suggests otherwise, you might assume the dog is **in front of** the house since this is often the default location unless specified otherwise.

Let's break it down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Rotation Formula**
When you rotate a point $(x, y)$ by 90 degrees clockwise around the origin, the new coordinates $(x', y')$ are given by:
$$
(x', y') = (y, -x)
$$
This means:
- The new $x$-coordinate becomes the original $y$-coordinate.
- The new $y$-coordinate becomes the negative of the original $x$-coordinate.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Formula to Each Vertex**

#### **Vertex A(2, 3):**
Using the formula $(x', y') = (y, -x)$:
$$
x' = 3, \quad y' = -2
$$
So, the new coordinates of $A$ are:
$$
A'(3, -2)
$$

#### **Vertex B(4, 5):**
Using the formula $(x', y') = (y, -x)$:
$$
x' = 5, \quad y' = -4

So, the new coordinates of $B$ are:
$$
B'(5, -4)
$$

#### **Vertex C(3, 1):**
Using the formula $(x', y') = (y, -x)$:
$$
x' = 1, \quad y' = -3
$$
So, the new coordinates of $C$ are:
$$
C'(1, -3)

### **Step 3: State the New Coordinates**
After rotating the triangle 90 degrees clockwise around the origin, the new coordinates of the vertices are:
$$
A'(3, -2), \quad B'(5, -4), \quad C'(1, -3)

---

### Step 1: Understand the reflection rule for the y-axis
When a point \((x, y)\) is reflected across the y-axis, its x-coordinate changes sign (positive becomes negative, and vice versa), while the y-coordinate remains unchanged. The general rule is:
\[
(x, y) \rightarrow (-x, y)
\]

---

### Step 2: Identify the original coordinates of the rectangle
The given rectangle has corners at:
- \(D(-1, -2)\)
- \(E(-1, 2)\)
- \(F(3, 2)\)
- \(G(3, -2)\)

---

### Step 3: Apply the reflection rule to each corner
Using the rule \((x, y) \rightarrow (-x, y)\), we calculate the new coordinates for each corner:

1. **Point \(D(-1, -2)\):**
   Reflecting across the y-axis:
   \[
   D' = (-(-1), -2) = (1, -2)
   \]

2. **Point \(E(-1, 2)\):**
   Reflecting across the y-axis:
   \[
   E' = (-(-1), 2) = (1, 2)
   \]

3. **Point \(F(3, 2)\):**
   Reflecting across the y-axis:
   \[
   F' = (-(3), 2) = (-3, 2)
   \]

4. **Point \(G(3, -2)\):**
   Reflecting across the y-axis:
   \[
   G' = (-(3), -2) = (-3, -2)
   \]

---

### Step 4: Write the coordinates of the reflected rectangle
The reflected rectangle has corners at:
- \(D'(1, -2)\)
- \(E'(1, 2)\)
- \(F'(-3, 2)\)
- \(G'(-3, -2)\)

---

### **Step 1: Understand the rotation transformation**
When a point $(x, y)$ is rotated 180 degrees about another point $(a, b)$, the new coordinates of the point are calculated using the formula:
$$
(x', y') = (2a - x, 2b - y)
$$
Here:
- $(x, y)$ are the original coordinates of the point.
- $(a, b)$ is the center of rotation.
- $(x', y')$ are the new coordinates after the rotation.

This formula works because rotating a point 180 degrees about a center effectively reflects the point across the center.

---

### **Step 2: Identify the given points and the center of rotation**
The square has vertices at:
- $H(1, 1)$,
- $I(1, 5)$,
- $J(5, 5)$,
- $K(5, 1)$.

The center of rotation is $(3, 3)$.

---

### **Step 3: Apply the rotation formula to each vertex**

#### **Vertex H(1, 1):**
Using the formula $(x', y') = (2a - x, 2b - y)$:
$$
x' = 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
$$
$$
y' = 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
$$
So, the new position of $H$ is $(5, 5)$.

#### **Vertex I(1, 5):**
Using the formula:
$$
x' = 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
$$
$$
y' = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1
$$
So, the new position of $I$ is $(5, 1)$.

#### **Vertex J(5, 5):**
Using the formula:
$$
x' = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1
$$
$$
y' = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1
$$
So, the new position of $J$ is $(1, 1)$.

#### **Vertex K(5, 1):**
Using the formula:
$$
x' = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1
$$
$$
y' = 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
$$
So, the new position of $K$ is $(1, 5)$.

### **Step 4: Write the final answer**
After rotating the square 180 degrees around the point $(3, 3)$, the new coordinates of the vertices are:
$$
\boxed{H'(5, 5), \, I'(5, 1), \, J'(1, 1), \, K'(1, 5)}

Here's how you can approach this step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Translation**
Translation involves shifting every point of a geometric figure by the same amount in the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions. In this case:
- Moving **two units left** means subtracting 2 from the x-coordinate of each vertex.
- Moving **three units down** means subtracting 3 from the y-coordinate of each vertex.

The general formula for translating a point $(x, y)$ is:
$$
(x', y') = (x - 2, y - 3)
$$

Here, $x'$ and $y'$ are the new coordinates after the translation.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Translation to Each Vertex**
The original vertices of the triangle are:
- Vertex 1: $(2, 3)$
- Vertex 2: $(4, 5)$
- Vertex 3: $(3, 7)$

We will apply the translation formula to each vertex.

#### **Vertex 1: $(2, 3)$**
Using the formula:
$$
(x', y') = (2 - 2, 3 - 3) = (0, 0)
$$
The new coordinates for Vertex 1 are $(0, 0)$.

#### **Vertex 2: $(4, 5)$**
Using the formula:
$$
(x', y') = (4 - 2, 5 - 3) = (2, 2)
$$
The new coordinates for Vertex 2 are $(2, 2)$.

#### **Vertex 3: $(3, 7)$**
Using the formula:
$$
(x', y') = (3 - 2, 7 - 3) = (1, 4)
$$
The new coordinates for Vertex 3 are $(1, 4)$.

---

### **Step 3: Write the Final Answer**
After translating the triangle, the new vertices are:
$$
\boxed{(0, 0), (2, 2), (1, 4)}
$$

---

### **Summary**
To translate a geometric figure, adjust the coordinates of each vertex according to the specified translation values. In this case, subtracting 2 from the x-coordinates and 3 from the y-coordinates gave us the new positions of the triangle's vertices."
"Space and form","Spatial orientation and positional relationships","F","Reflect the rectangle with corners at (1 1) (1 4) (4 1) and (4 4) across the y-axis and list the coordinates of the reflected rectangle.","To solve the problem of reflecting a rectangle across the y-axis, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the reflection rule
When you reflect a point across the y-axis:
- The **x-coordinate** changes sign (positive becomes negative, and vice versa).
- The **y-coordinate** remains unchanged.

For example, if a point is at \((x, y)\), its reflection across the y-axis will be at \((-x, y)\).

### Step 2: Identify the original coordinates of the rectangle
The rectangle has corners at:
- \((1, 1)\)
- \((1, 4)\)
- \((4, 1)\)
- \((4, 4)\)

### Step 3: Apply the reflection rule to each corner
Using the rule that \(x\) changes sign while \(y\) stays the same, we can calculate the reflected coordinates for each corner:

1. Reflect \((1, 1)\):
   - Original: \((1, 1)\)
   - Reflected: \((-1, 1)\)

2. Reflect \((1, 4)\):
   - Original: \((1, 4)\)
   - Reflected: \((-1, 4)\)

3. Reflect \((4, 1)\):
   - Original: \((4, 1)\)
   - Reflected: \((-4, 1)\)

4. Reflect \((4, 4)\):
   - Original: \((4, 4)\)
   - Reflected: \((-4, 4)\)

### Step 4: List the reflected coordinates

Let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Translation
A **translation** is a transformation that moves every point of a figure the same distance in the same direction. In this case:
- The translation is **3 units right** (positive x-direction).
- The translation is **2 units up** (positive y-direction).

This means that for each vertex of the quadrilateral, we will add 3 to the x-coordinate and 2 to the y-coordinate.

---

### Step 2: Identify the Original Vertices
The vertices of the quadrilateral are given as:
- \( A(5, 2) \)
- \( B(5, 6) \)
- \( C(8, 2) \)
- \( D(8, 6) \)

These points form a rectangle because opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.

---

### Step 3: Apply the Translation
For each vertex, add 3 to the x-coordinate and 2 to the y-coordinate:

1. For \( A(5, 2) \):
   \[
   A'(x', y') = (5 + 3, 2 + 2) = (8, 4)
   \]

2. For \( B(5, 6) \):
   \[
   B'(x', y') = (5 + 3, 6 + 2) = (8, 8)
   \]

3. For \( C(8, 2) \):
   \[
   C'(x', y') = (8 + 3, 2 + 2) = (11, 4)
   \]

4. For \( D(8, 6) \):
   \[
   D'(x', y') = (8 + 3, 6 + 2) = (11, 8)
   \]

Thus, the new vertices of the translated quadrilateral are:
- \( A'(8, 4) \)
- \( B'(8, 8) \)
- \( C'(11, 4) \)
- \( D'(11, 8) \)

---

### Step 4: Sketch the Resulting Figure
To sketch the translated quadrilateral:
1. Plot the original vertices \( A(5, 2) \), \( B(5, 6) \), \( C(8, 2) \), and \( D(8, 6) \) on a coordinate plane.
2. Plot the translated vertices \( A'(8, 4) \), \( B'(8, 8) \), \( C'(11, 4) \), and \( D'(11, 8) \).
3. Connect the translated vertices \( A' \), \( B' \), \( C' \), and \( D' \) to form the new rectangle.

---

### Final Answer
The vertices of the translated quadrilateral are:
\[
\boxed{A'(8, 4), B'(8, 8), C'(11, 4), D'(11, 8)}

- Position the square below or beside the triangle.

#### Step 6: Fill the Square with Blue
- Select the square shape.
- Choose the fill color option and set it to blue.

---

### **3. Using Programming (Python with Turtle Graphics)**

If you want to solve this task programmatically, Python's `turtle` module is a great choice for drawing shapes.

#### Step 1: Install Python
- Ensure Python is installed on your computer.

#### Step 2: Write the Code
Here’s a sample Python script to draw the triangle and square:

```python
import turtle

# Set up the screen
screen = turtle.Screen()
screen.bgcolor(""white"")

# Create a turtle object
pen = turtle.Turtle()

# Draw a large red triangle
pen.fillcolor(""red"")
pen.begin_fill()
for _ in range(3):  # Triangle has 3 sides
    pen.forward(200)  # Length of each side
    pen.left(120)     # Angle between sides
pen.end_fill()

# Move to a new position for the square
pen.penup()
pen.goto(100, -100)  # Adjust coordinates as needed
pen.pendown()

# Draw a blue square
pen.fillcolor(""blue"")
pen.begin_fill()
for _ in range(4):  # Square has 4 sides
    pen.forward(150)  # Length of each side
    pen.right(90)     # Angle between sides
pen.end_fill()

# Finish and close the window on click
screen.exitonclick()
```

#### Step 3: Run the Code
- Save the script in a `.py` file and run it.
- A window will open displaying the red triangle and blue square.

---

### **Summary**

Below, I'll break it down into two approaches: **using image editing software** and **using programming**.

---

### **Approach 1: Using Image Editing Software (e.g., Photoshop, GIMP, or Paint)**

1. **Open the Image**: Load the picture into your preferred image editing software.
   
2. **Identify Circles**:
   - Use the selection tools (e.g., lasso, magic wand, or shape selection) to manually select circular objects in the image.
   - If the circles are distinct and have uniform properties (e.g., color, size), you might use advanced selection tools like ""Select by Color"" or ""Select by Shape.""

3. **Color the Circles Green**:
   - Once the circles are selected, fill them with green using the ""Fill"" or ""Paint Bucket"" tool.
   - Ensure the green color is set as the foreground color before filling.

4. **Repeat for All Circles**: Continue selecting and coloring each circle until all circles in the image are green.

5. **Save the Edited Image**: Save the modified image in your desired format (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

---

### **Approach 2: Using Programming (e.g., Python with OpenCV or PIL)**

If you want an automated solution, you can write a script to detect and color the circles programmatically. Here's how:

#### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have Python installed, along with libraries like `opencv-python` and `numpy`. You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

#### Step 2: Write the Code
Here’s a sample Python script using OpenCV to detect and color circles:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the image
image = cv2.imread('input_image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale for circle detection
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply GaussianBlur to reduce noise and improve circle detection
gray_blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (9, 9), 2)

# Detect circles using HoughCircles
circles = cv2.HoughCircles(
    gray_blurred,
    cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT,
    dp=1,
    minDist=20,
    param1=50,
    param2=30,
    minRadius=0,
    maxRadius=0
)

if circles is not None:
    # Convert the circle parameters to integers
    circles = np.uint16(np.around(circles))

    # Iterate over detected circles and color them green
    for i in circles[0, :]:
        center = (i[0], i[1])  # Circle center
        radius = i[2]          # Circle radius

        # Draw a filled green circle
        cv2.circle(image, center, radius, (0, 255, 0), thickness=-1)  # Green color

# Save the output image
cv2.imwrite('output_image.jpg', image)

# Optionally, display the result
cv2.imshow('Colored Circles', image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

#### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Load the Image**: The image is loaded using `cv2.imread`.
2. **Preprocess the Image**: Convert the image to grayscale and apply Gaussian blur to smooth it.
3. **Detect Circles**: Use the `cv2.HoughCircles` function to detect circles based on their geometric properties.
4. **Color the Circles**: For each detected circle, draw a filled green circle at the same location using `cv2.circle`.
5. **Save/Display the Result**: Save the modified image and optionally display it.

---

### **Key Considerations**
- **Circle Detection Accuracy**: The accuracy of circle detection depends on the quality of the input image and the parameters of `HoughCircles`. You may need to adjust parameters like `minDist`, `param1`, and `param2` for better results.
- **Complex Backgrounds**: If the image has complex backgrounds or overlapping shapes, preprocessing steps like edge detection or thresholding might be necessary.
- **Non-Circular Shapes**: Ensure that only true circles are detected. Adjust parameters carefully to avoid false positives.

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","B","Look at the shapes in the box and color all the squares purple.","Certainly! Let's break this task down step by step so you can understand how to solve it:

### 1. **Understand the Task**
   - The task asks you to ""look at the shapes in the box"" and ""color all the squares purple.""
   - This means you need to identify which shapes are squares and then color them purple.

---

### 2. **Identify the Shapes**
   - Look at the box or area where the shapes are located.
   - Observe each shape carefully. A square is a specific type of shape with these characteristics:
     - It has **four sides**.
     - All four sides are **equal in length**.
     - All four angles are **right angles (90 degrees)**.

   - Other shapes like circles, triangles, rectangles, or diamonds do not meet these criteria, so they are not squares.

---

### 3. **Locate the Squares**
   - Go through each shape one by one and check if it matches the definition of a square.
   - If a shape has four equal sides and four right angles, mark it mentally or physically as a square.

---

### 4. **Color the Squares Purple**
   - Once you have identified all the squares, take a purple coloring tool (like a marker, crayon, or colored pencil).
   - Carefully color each square completely purple, ensuring that no other shapes are accidentally colored.

---

### 5. **Double-Check Your Work**
   - After coloring, review the box again to confirm:
     - You correctly identified all the squares.
     - Only the squares are colored purple.
     - No other shapes were mistakenly colored.

---

### Example Scenario:
If the box contains the following shapes:
   - A circle
   - A triangle
   - Two squares
   - A rectangle

You would only color the **two squares** purple because they meet the criteria for being squares, while the others do not.

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","C","Draw a rectangle and label its four sides and two right angles.","To solve the task of drawing a rectangle and labeling its four sides and two right angles, follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the properties of a rectangle**
A rectangle is a quadrilateral (a shape with four sides) that has the following characteristics:
- Opposite sides are equal in length.
- All interior angles are right angles (90 degrees).
- It has four sides and four vertices (corners).

---

### **Step 2: Draw the rectangle**
1. Take a pencil, ruler, or any drawing tool.
2. Draw two horizontal parallel lines of equal length.
3. Connect the ends of these lines with two vertical parallel lines of equal length.
4. Ensure that all four corners form right angles.

Your rectangle should now look like a closed shape with four sides.

---

### **Step 3: Label the four sides**
1. Assign labels to each side of the rectangle. Commonly, you can use letters such as $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, and $DA$ to represent the sides.
   - $AB$: Top horizontal side
   - $BC$: Right vertical side
   - $CD$: Bottom horizontal side
   - $DA$: Left vertical side

Alternatively, you can label the sides numerically as Side 1, Side 2, Side 3, and Side 4.

---

### **Step 4: Identify and label the right angles**
1. A rectangle has **four right angles**, one at each corner.
2. To label two of these right angles:
   - Choose any two corners, for example, the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner.
   - Mark these corners with a small square symbol (commonly used to indicate a right angle) or write ""90°"" next to them.

---

### **Step 5: Finalize your diagram**
Ensure your rectangle is neatly drawn, and all labels are clearly visible. Your final diagram should include:
- Four labeled sides ($AB$, $BC$, $CD$, $DA$ or similar notation).
- Two labeled right angles (e.g., top-left and bottom-right corners).

---

### **Example Diagram**
Here’s how your labeled rectangle might look:

```
    A --------------- B
    |                 |
    |                 |   (Right angle at A and C)
    |                 |
    D --------------- C

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","C","Sketch a triangle with different side lengths and mark its three angles as acute right or obtuse.","To solve this task, you need to sketch a triangle with different side lengths and determine the type of each angle (acute, right, or obtuse). Here's how you can approach it step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Triangle Types
- **Acute Triangle**: All three angles are less than 90°.
- **Right Triangle**: One angle is exactly 90°.
- **Obtuse Triangle**: One angle is greater than 90°.

For this task, you will sketch a triangle with **different side lengths**, meaning it is a **scalene triangle**. A scalene triangle has no equal sides or equal angles.

---

### Step 2: Sketch the Triangle
1. Draw a triangle where all three sides have different lengths. You can use a ruler to ensure the sides are unequal.
   - For example:
     - Side A = 5 cm
     - Side B = 7 cm
     - Side C = 9 cm

2. Label the vertices of the triangle as $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $.

---

### Step 3: Determine the Angles
To classify the angles as acute, right, or obtuse, you can either:
- Use geometric reasoning based on the side lengths, or
- Measure the angles using a protractor.

#### Option 1: Geometric Reasoning
In any triangle:
- The largest angle is opposite the longest side.
- The smallest angle is opposite the shortest side.

Using the example above:
- Side C (9 cm) is the longest, so the angle opposite it ($ \angle A $) is likely the largest.
- Side A (5 cm) is the shortest, so the angle opposite it ($ \angle C $) is likely the smallest.

If the triangle is not a right triangle, the largest angle could be acute or obtuse depending on the side lengths. To confirm:
- If $ c^2 < a^2 + b^2 $, all angles are acute (acute triangle).
- If $ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 $, the triangle is a right triangle.
- If $ c^2 > a^2 + b^2 $, the triangle has one obtuse angle.

#### Option 2: Measuring Angles with a Protractor
- Use a protractor to measure each angle directly.
- Classify each angle:
  - Acute: Less than 90°
  - Right: Exactly 90°
  - Obtuse: Greater than 90°

---

### Step 4: Mark the Angles
Once you've determined the type of each angle, label them accordingly in your sketch:
- Write ""Acute"" next to any angle that is less than 90°.
- Write ""Right"" if any angle is exactly 90°.
- Write ""Obtuse"" if any angle is greater than 90°.

---

### Example
Let’s say you drew a triangle with the following measurements:
- Side A = 5 cm
- Side B = 7 cm

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Properties of a Square**
A square is a type of quadrilateral with the following properties:
- It has **four equal sides**.
- It has **four right angles** (each angle measures 90 degrees).
- Opposite sides are parallel.

---

### **Step 2: Draw the Square**
1. Use a ruler or a straightedge to draw a square on paper or digitally.
2. Ensure that all four sides are of equal length. You can use a compass or measure with a ruler to confirm this.
3. Make sure each corner forms a right angle (90 degrees). You can use a protractor to verify this if needed.

---

### **Step 3: Label the Four Equal Sides**
1. Assign labels to the four sides of the square. For example:
   - Label the top side as **AB**.
   - Label the right side as **BC**.
   - Label the bottom side as **CD**.
   - Label the left side as **DA**.
2. Indicate that these sides are equal in length by marking them with small hatch marks (short lines) or writing ""AB = BC = CD = DA"" next to the diagram.

---

### **Step 4: Label the Four Right Angles**
1. Identify the four corners of the square where the sides meet.
2. Label the angles at these corners:
   - The top-left corner can be labeled as ∠DAB.
   - The top-right corner can be labeled as ∠ABC.
   - The bottom-right corner can be labeled as ∠BCD.
   - The bottom-left corner can be labeled as ∠CDA.
3. Indicate that each angle is a right angle by drawing a small square at each corner or writing ""∠DAB = ∠ABC = ∠BCD = ∠CDA = 90°"" next to the diagram.

---

### **Step 5: Final Check**
- Double-check that all four sides are equal in length.
- Verify that all four angles are right angles.
- Ensure your labels clearly identify the sides and angles.

---

### **Optional: Add Coordinates (if working in a coordinate plane)**
If you're working in a coordinate plane, you can define the vertices of the square using coordinates:
- Let the vertices be A(x₁, y₁), B(x₂, y₁), C(x₂, y₂), and D(x₁, y₂).
- The sides will then be:
  - AB: Horizontal side from A to B.
  - BC: Vertical side from B to C.
  - CD: Horizontal side from C to D.
  - DA: Vertical side from D to A.

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","C","Draw a right angle in the corner of a square and label it as ""Right Angle.""","To solve the task of drawing a right angle in the corner of a square and labeling it as ""Right Angle,"" follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
A **right angle** is an angle that measures exactly 90 degrees. A **square** is a geometric shape with four equal sides and four right angles at its corners. The task requires you to:
1. Draw a square.
2. Identify one of its corners (where two sides meet).
3. Highlight or emphasize the right angle at that corner.
4. Label it as ""Right Angle.""

---

### Step 2: Draw the Square
1. Use a ruler or straightedge to draw a square. Ensure all four sides are of equal length, and the angles between adjacent sides are 90 degrees.
   - If you're drawing by hand, use a protractor to confirm the angles are 90 degrees.
   - Alternatively, if you're using software, ensure the tool creates a perfect square.

---

### Step 3: Identify a Corner
Choose any one of the four corners of the square. For simplicity, let’s choose the bottom-left corner.

---

### Step 4: Highlight the Right Angle
To visually emphasize the right angle:
1. Draw a small arc or curve starting from one side of the corner and ending on the other side, forming a quarter-circle around the vertex of the angle.
   - This arc indicates the presence of the right angle.
2. Alternatively, you can draw a small square at the vertex of the angle. This is a common mathematical notation for a right angle.

---

### Step 5: Label the Right Angle
Near the highlighted right angle, write the label ""Right Angle"" clearly. Make sure the text is positioned so it doesn’t overlap with the square or obscure the drawing.

---

### Final Result
Your diagram should now include:
- A square with four equal sides.
- One corner (e.g., the bottom-left) highlighted to show the right angle.
- The label ""Right Angle"" near the highlighted corner.

If you’re using digital tools, you can use shapes, arcs, and text boxes to achieve the same effect.

### Example Diagram Description:

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","C","In the triangle provided identify one acute angle and shade it then label it as ""Acute Angle.""","To solve the task of identifying an acute angle in a triangle, shading it, and labeling it as ""Acute Angle,"" follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand What an Acute Angle Is
An **acute angle** is any angle that measures less than 90 degrees. In a triangle, there are always at least two acute angles because the sum of all three angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees.

### Step 2: Examine the Triangle
Look at the given triangle and identify its angles. If the triangle is labeled with vertices (e.g., A, B, C), note the angles at each vertex (∠A, ∠B, ∠C). You may need to estimate or measure the angles if no specific measurements are provided.

- If the triangle is drawn with approximate angle sizes, you can visually determine which angles appear to be less than 90 degrees.
- If the triangle has specific angle measurements, check which angles are less than 90 degrees.

### Step 3: Identify One Acute Angle
Choose one of the angles in the triangle that is less than 90 degrees. For example:
- If the triangle has angles measuring 45°, 60°, and 75°, all three are acute angles. You can choose any one of them.
- If the triangle has angles measuring 30°, 60°, and 90° (a right triangle), the 30° and 60° angles are acute. Choose one of these.

### Step 4: Shade the Acute Angle
Using a pencil, colored pencil, or marker, shade the interior of the chosen acute angle. Make sure the shading clearly indicates the region enclosed by the two sides forming the angle.

### Step 5: Label the Acute Angle
Near the shaded angle, write the label ""Acute Angle"" so that it is clear which angle you have identified and shaded. Ensure the label does not overlap with other parts of the triangle or obscure important details.

---

### Example Walkthrough:
Suppose you are given a triangle with angles ∠A = 45°, ∠B = 60°, and ∠C = 75°.

1. **Identify an acute angle**: All three angles are acute since they are less than 90°. Let’s choose ∠A = 45°.
2. **Shade ∠A**: Use a colored pencil to shade the region between the two sides forming ∠A.
3. **Label the angle**: Write ""Acute Angle"" near ∠A to indicate your choice.

---

By following these steps, you will successfully complete the task of identifying, shading, and labeling an acute angle in the triangle."
"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","C","Using a ruler create a shape that includes at least two right angles and one acute angle then label each angle accordingly.","To solve this task, you need to create a shape using a ruler that includes at least two right angles and one acute angle. Then, you will label each angle accordingly. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you complete the task:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Requirements**
- **Right Angle**: An angle that measures exactly 90°.
- **Acute Angle**: An angle that measures less than 90°.
- You need to create a shape with:
  - At least **two right angles**.
  - At least **one acute angle**.

---

### **Step 2: Plan Your Shape**
A simple shape that satisfies these requirements is a **trapezoid** (or trapezium in some regions). A trapezoid can have two right angles and one acute angle, depending on how you draw it.

---

### **Step 3: Draw the Shape**
1. **Draw the Base Line**:
   - Use your ruler to draw a horizontal line. This will serve as the base of your shape.

2. **Add Two Perpendicular Lines**:
   - From each end of the base line, draw vertical lines upward using your ruler. These lines should meet the base at right angles (90°).

3. **Connect the Top with an Oblique Line**:
   - From the top ends of the two vertical lines, draw a slanted line connecting them. Make sure this line creates an acute angle with one of the vertical lines.

4. **Check Your Angles**:
   - Ensure that:
     - The two angles where the vertical lines meet the base are right angles (90°).
     - The angle formed by the slanted line and one of the vertical lines is acute (< 90°).

---

### **Step 4: Label the Angles**
1. Identify each angle in your shape:
   - Label the two right angles as **90°**.
   - Label the acute angle with a note such as ""Acute Angle (< 90°)"".
   - If there is a fourth angle (depending on your shape), label it appropriately (e.g., obtuse if it's greater than 90°).

2. Use small arcs near each vertex to clearly indicate which angle corresponds to which label.

---

### **Step 5: Verify Your Work**
Double-check that:
- Your shape has at least two right angles.
- Your shape has at least one acute angle.
- All angles are labeled correctly.

---

---

### **Step 1: Gather Your Tools**
Ensure you have the following tools:
- A ruler (preferably with centimeter markings),
- A pencil,
- Optionally, a compass for precision.

---

### **Step 2: Draw the Line Segment $ AB $**
1. Place your ruler on the paper.
2. Mark a point $ A $ at one end of the ruler.
3. Measure 8 cm along the ruler from point $ A $, and mark another point $ B $ at this position.
4. Use the ruler to draw a straight line connecting $ A $ and $ B $. Label the endpoints as $ A $ and $ B $.

Now you have a line segment $ AB $ with a length of 8 cm.

---

### **Step 3: Find the Midpoint $ M $**
To find the midpoint $ M $, divide the length of $ AB $ into two equal parts. Since $ AB = 8 \, \text{cm} $, the midpoint will be located at $ 4 \, \text{cm} $ from either endpoint.

#### Method 1: Using the Ruler
1. Place the ruler along the line segment $ AB $.
2. Locate the 4 cm mark starting from point $ A $.
3. Mark this point as $ M $.

#### Method 2: Using a Compass (Optional but More Precise)
1. Set the compass to a radius greater than half the length of $ AB $ (i.e., greater than $ 4 \, \text{cm} $).
2. Place the compass needle at point $ A $ and draw an arc above and below the line segment $ AB $.
3. Without changing the compass width, place the needle at point $ B $ and draw another arc above and below the line segment $ AB $. The arcs should intersect at two points.
4. Use a ruler to draw a straight line through the intersection points of the arcs. This line will bisect $ AB $ at the midpoint $ M $.
5. Mark the intersection of this perpendicular line with $ AB $ as $ M $.

---

### **Step 4: Verify the Midpoint**
To confirm that $ M $ is indeed the midpoint:
- Measure the distances $ AM $ and $ MB $ using the ruler.
- Both distances should be exactly $ 4 \, \text{cm} $.

---

### **Final Result**
You now have a line segment $ AB $ of length 8 cm, with its midpoint $ M $ accurately marked.

---

### **Step 1: Draw the Line Segment**
1. Use your straightedge to draw a line segment $ CD $ of length 10 cm.
2. Label the endpoints as $ C $ and $ D $.

---

### **Step 2: Set the Compass Width**
1. Open your compass so that the distance between the needle and the pencil is greater than half the length of $ CD $. Since $ CD = 10 \, \text{cm} $, you can set the compass width to any value greater than $ 5 \, \text{cm} $ (e.g., $ 6 \, \text{cm} $).

---

### **Step 3: Draw Arcs from Point $ C $**
1. Place the needle of the compass at point $ C $.
2. Draw an arc above and below the line segment $ CD $. Make sure the arcs extend far enough on both sides.

---

### **Step 4: Draw Arcs from Point $ D $**
1. Without changing the compass width, place the needle of the compass at point $ D $.
2. Draw another pair of arcs above and below the line segment $ CD $, ensuring they intersect the arcs drawn from point $ C $.

---

### **Step 5: Identify Intersection Points**
1. The two arcs drawn above $ CD $ will intersect at one point. Label this intersection point as $ P $.
2. The two arcs drawn below $ CD $ will intersect at another point. Label this intersection point as $ Q $.

---

### **Step 6: Draw the Perpendicular Bisector**
1. Use your straightedge to draw a straight line through points $ P $ and $ Q $. This line is the perpendicular bisector of $ CD $.
2. Extend the line slightly beyond points $ P $ and $ Q $ for clarity.

---

### **Step 7: Label the Midpoint**
1. The perpendicular bisector intersects the line segment $ CD $ at its midpoint. Label this intersection point as $ M $.
2. Point $ M $ divides $ CD $ into two equal parts ($ CM = MD = 5 \, \text{cm} $).

---

### **Final Answer**
The perpendicular bisector of $ CD $ has been constructed, and the intersection points are:
- $ P $: The intersection point above $ CD $,

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","E","Create two points E and F on a piece of paper measure the distance between them and then find and draw the bisector of segment EF labeling the midpoint N.","To solve this task, you will need a piece of paper, a ruler, a pencil, and optionally a compass. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how to create the points $E$ and $F$, measure the distance between them, find the midpoint $N$, and draw the bisector of segment $EF$:

---

### Step 1: Create Points $E$ and $F$
1. Take your piece of paper and use your pencil to mark two distinct points anywhere on the paper. Label these points as $E$ and $F$. These points can be placed at any arbitrary locations, but ensure they are far enough apart so that you can easily work with them.

---

### Step 2: Measure the Distance Between $E$ and $F$
1. Use your ruler to measure the straight-line distance between points $E$ and $F$. Align the edge of the ruler along the line connecting $E$ and $F$.
2. Record the measured distance (e.g., in centimeters or inches).

---

### Step 3: Find the Midpoint $N$
1. To locate the midpoint $N$ of segment $EF$, divide the measured distance by 2. This gives you the halfway point between $E$ and $F$.
   - For example, if the distance between $E$ and $F$ is 10 cm, then the midpoint is located 5 cm away from both $E$ and $F$.
2. Use your ruler to carefully mark the midpoint along the segment $EF$. Label this point as $N$.

---

### Step 4: Draw the Perpendicular Bisector of Segment $EF$
The perpendicular bisector is a line that passes through the midpoint $N$ and is perpendicular to segment $EF$. Follow these steps to construct it:
1. **Using a Compass** (optional but recommended for precision):
   - Place the compass needle on point $E$ and adjust the compass width to slightly more than half the length of $EF$.
   - Draw an arc above and below the segment $EF$.
   - Without changing the compass width, place the needle on point $F$ and draw another arc above and below the segment $EF$, intersecting the arcs drawn from $E$.
   - You should now have two intersection points above and below the segment $EF$.
2. **Draw the Line**:
   - Use your ruler to connect the two intersection points with a straight line. This line is the perpendicular bisector of segment $EF$.
   - Ensure the line passes directly through the midpoint $N$.

---

### Final Steps
1. Label the perpendicular bisector clearly on your diagram.
2. Double-check your work by ensuring that the line is indeed perpendicular to $EF$ and passes through $N$.

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","E","Plot the following coordinates on a grid: A(2 3) B(5 5) C(4 1) and D(1 2) then connect the points to form a polygon and identify its name.","To solve this task, you will follow a step-by-step process to plot the given points on a grid, connect them to form a polygon, and then identify the type of polygon formed. Here's how you can do it:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Coordinates
The coordinates provided are:
- **A(2, 3)**: This means point A is located at \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\).
- **B(5, 5)**: This means point B is located at \(x = 5\) and \(y = 5\).
- **C(4, 1)**: This means point C is located at \(x = 4\) and \(y = 1\).
- **D(1, 2)**: This means point D is located at \(x = 1\) and \(y = 2\).

---

### Step 2: Plot the Points on a Grid
1. Draw a Cartesian coordinate plane with an \(x\)-axis (horizontal) and a \(y\)-axis (vertical).
2. Mark the points \(A(2, 3)\), \(B(5, 5)\), \(C(4, 1)\), and \(D(1, 2)\) on the grid.
   - Start from the origin \((0, 0)\), move along the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis to locate each point.

---

### Step 3: Connect the Points
Once the points are plotted, connect them in the order given: \(A \to B \to C \to D \to A\). This will form a closed shape or polygon.

---

### Step 4: Identify the Polygon
Now that the points are connected, analyze the shape formed:
1. Count the number of sides:
   - Since there are 4 points (\(A, B, C, D\)), the polygon has 4 sides. Therefore, it is a **quadrilateral**.
   
2. Check for special properties:
   - Measure the lengths of the sides and angles (if possible) to determine if the quadrilateral is a specific type, such as a square, rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, trapezoid, or kite.
   - Alternatively, observe the symmetry or other geometric properties.

---

### Step 5: Verify the Shape
Let’s calculate the distances between consecutive points to check if any sides are equal or parallel:
1. Distance formula: The distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
   \]

2. Calculate the distances:
   - \(AB = \sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (5 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4} = \sqrt{13}\)
   - \(BC = \sqrt{(4 - 5)^2 + (1 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 16} = \sqrt{17}\)
   - \(CD = \sqrt{(1 - 4)^2 + (2 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{9 + 1} = \sqrt{10}\)
   - \(DA = \sqrt{(2 - 1)^2 + (3 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2}\)

Since all four sides have different lengths, the quadrilateral is not a square, rectangle, rhombus, or parallelogram. It is a general **quadrilateral**.

---

### Final Answer:
The polygon formed by connecting the points \(A(2, 3)\), \(B(5, 5)\), \(C(4, 1)\), and \(D(1, 2)\) is a **quadrilateral**. 

If you want to classify it further, you could check for parallel sides or other properties, but based on the given information, it is simply a general quadrilateral.

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","E","Using the coordinates E(3 4) F(6 7) G(5 3) and H(2 1) plot the points on a grid and determine if the figure formed is a quadrilateral or a triangle.","To solve this task, you will need to follow a step-by-step approach. Let's break it down:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
You are given four points in the coordinate plane:
- $ E(3, 4) $
- $ F(6, 7) $
- $ G(5, 3) $
- $ H(2, 1) $

Your goal is to:
1. Plot these points on a grid.
2. Determine whether the figure formed by connecting these points is a **quadrilateral** (a four-sided polygon) or a **triangle**.

---

### Step 2: Plot the Points
Using graph paper or a digital tool, plot the points $ E(3, 4) $, $ F(6, 7) $, $ G(5, 3) $, and $ H(2, 1) $. The x-coordinate represents the horizontal position, and the y-coordinate represents the vertical position.

---

### Step 3: Connect the Points
Connect the points in the order they are given ($ E \to F \to G \to H \to E $) to form a closed figure. If all four points are distinct and no three points are collinear (lying on the same straight line), the figure will be a quadrilateral. However, if any three of the points are collinear, the figure will degenerate into a triangle.

---

### Step 4: Check for Collinearity
To determine if the figure is a quadrilateral or a triangle, check if any three points are collinear. To do this, calculate the slope between pairs of points. If the slopes between three points are equal, those points are collinear.

#### Formula for Slope:
The slope between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is:
$$
\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

#### Calculate Slopes:
1. Slope between $ E(3, 4) $ and $ F(6, 7) $:
   $$
   \text{slope}_{EF} = \frac{7 - 4}{6 - 3} = \frac{3}{3} = 1
   $$

2. Slope between $ F(6, 7) $ and $ G(5, 3) $:
   $$
   \text{slope}_{FG} = \frac{3 - 7}{5 - 6} = \frac{-4}{-1} = 4
   $$

3. Slope between $ G(5, 3) $ and $ H(2, 1) $:
   $$
   \text{slope}_{GH} = \frac{1 - 3}{2 - 5} = \frac{-2}{-3} = \frac{2}{3}
   $$

4. Slope between $ H(2, 1) $ and $ E(3, 4) $:
   $$
   \text{slope}_{HE} = \frac{4 - 1}{3 - 2} = \frac{3}{1} = 3
   $$

#### Analyze the Results:
- The slopes between the consecutive points ($ EF, FG, GH, HE $) are different. This means that no three points are collinear.
- Since all four points are distinct and no three points lie on the same line, the figure formed is a **quadrilateral**.

---

### Step 5: Conclusion
The figure formed by the points $ E(3, 4) $, $ F(6, 7) $, $ G(5, 3) $, and $ H(2, 1) $ is a **quadrilateral**.

---

### **Step 1: Draw a Coordinate Grid**
- Begin by drawing a coordinate grid with the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical). Label both axes with appropriate scales.
- Ensure that the grid includes at least the points J(1, 1), K(4, 1), L(4, 4), and M(1, 4).

---

### **Step 2: Plot the Points**
- Locate each point on the grid:
  - **J(1, 1):** Start at the origin (0, 0), move 1 unit to the right along the x-axis and 1 unit up along the y-axis.
  - **K(4, 1):** Move 4 units to the right along the x-axis and 1 unit up along the y-axis.
  - **L(4, 4):** Move 4 units to the right along the x-axis and 4 units up along the y-axis.
  - **M(1, 4):** Move 1 unit to the right along the x-axis and 4 units up along the y-axis.

### **Step 4: Describe the Shape**
- Observe the shape formed by connecting the points. The points J(1, 1), K(4, 1), L(4, 4), and M(1, 4) create a rectangle because:
  - Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
  - All angles are right angles (90°).

### **Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter**
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","G","Find the equations of the lines that form the sides of a triangle with vertices at points A(2 3) B(5 7) and C(4 1).","To find the equations of the lines that form the sides of a triangle with vertices at points $ A(2, 3) $, $ B(5, 7) $, and $ C(4, 1) $, follow these steps:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The triangle is formed by three line segments:
- Line segment $ AB $ (connecting points $ A $ and $ B $),
- Line segment $ BC $ (connecting points $ B $ and $ C $),
- Line segment $ CA $ (connecting points $ C $ and $ A $).

Each line segment can be represented by its equation in slope-intercept form ($ y = mx + c $), where $ m $ is the slope of the line and $ c $ is the y-intercept.

---

### Step 2: Find the Slope of Each Line Segment
The slope $ m $ of a line passing through two points $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $ is given by:
$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.
$$

#### For Line $ AB $:
Points: $ A(2, 3) $ and $ B(5, 7) $.
$$
m_{AB} = \frac{7 - 3}{5 - 2} = \frac{4}{3}.
$$

#### For Line $ BC $:
Points: $ B(5, 7) $ and $ C(4, 1) $.
$$
m_{BC} = \frac{1 - 7}{4 - 5} = \frac{-6}{-1} = 6.
$$

#### For Line $ CA $:
Points: $ C(4, 1) $ and $ A(2, 3) $.
$$
m_{CA} = \frac{3 - 1}{2 - 4} = \frac{2}{-2} = -1.
$$

---

### Step 3: Write the Equation of Each Line
Using the point-slope form of a line equation:
$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1),
$$
where $ (x_1, y_1) $ is a point on the line and $ m $ is the slope.

#### Equation of Line $ AB $:
Slope: $ m_{AB} = \frac{4}{3} $, Point: $ A(2, 3) $.
$$
y - 3 = \frac{4}{3}(x - 2).
$$
Simplify:
$$
y - 3 = \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{8}{3}.
$$
$$
y = \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{8}{3} + 3.
$$
Convert $ 3 $ to a fraction with denominator 3:
$$
y = \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{8}{3} + \frac{9}{3}.
$$
$$
y = \frac{4}{3}x + \frac{1}{3}.
$$

#### Equation of Line $ BC $:
Slope: $ m_{BC} = 6 $, Point: $ B(5, 7) $.
$$
y - 7 = 6(x - 5).
$$
Simplify:
$$
y - 7 = 6x - 30.
$$
$$
y = 6x - 30 + 7.
$$
$$
y = 6x - 23.
$$

#### Equation of Line $ CA $:
Slope: $ m_{CA} = -1 $, Point: $ C(4, 1) $.
$$
y - 1 = -1(x - 4).
$$
Simplify:
$$
y - 1 = -x + 4.
$$
$$
y = -x + 4 + 1.
$$
$$
y = -x + 5.
$$

### Final Answer:
The equations of the lines forming the sides of the triangle are:
$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\text{Line } AB: & \quad y = \frac{4}{3}x + \frac{1}{3}, \\
\text{Line } BC: & \quad y = 6x - 23, \\
\text{Line } CA: & \quad y = -x + 5.

Let's break this problem into clear steps.

### Step 1: Understand the vertices
The vertices of the rectangle are:
- $ A(-1, -2) $
- $ B(-1, 2) $
- $ C(3, 2) $
- $ D(3, -2) $

From the coordinates, we can see:
- The points $ A(-1, -2) $ and $ B(-1, 2) $ share the same $ x $-coordinate ($ x = -1 $), so they form a **vertical line**.
- The points $ B(-1, 2) $ and $ C(3, 2) $ share the same $ y $-coordinate ($ y = 2 $), so they form a **horizontal line**.
- The points $ C(3, 2) $ and $ D(3, -2) $ share the same $ x $-coordinate ($ x = 3 $), so they form another **vertical line**.
- The points $ D(3, -2) $ and $ A(-1, -2) $ share the same $ y $-coordinate ($ y = -2 $), so they form another **horizontal line**.

### Step 2: Write the equations for each side
Now, let's write the equations for the four sides:

#### Side 1: Vertical line through $ A(-1, -2) $ and $ B(-1, 2) $
This line has a constant $ x $-value of $ -1 $. Therefore, the equation is:
$$
x = -1
$$

#### Side 2: Horizontal line through $ B(-1, 2) $ and $ C(3, 2) $
This line has a constant $ y $-value of $ 2 $. Therefore, the equation is:
$$
y = 2
$$

#### Side 3: Vertical line through $ C(3, 2) $ and $ D(3, -2) $
This line has a constant $ x $-value of $ 3 $. Therefore, the equation is:
$$
x = 3
$$

#### Side 4: Horizontal line through $ D(3, -2) $ and $ A(-1, -2) $
This line has a constant $ y $-value of $ -2 $. Therefore, the equation is:
$$
y = -2

Below is a detailed explanation of how to achieve this:

---

### **Step-by-Step Construction**

#### **1. Draw the Base Line**
- Use your straightedge to draw a straight line segment of length **8 cm**.
- Label the endpoints of the line segment as **A** and **B**.

#### **2. Set the Compass to the Side Length**
- Open your compass so that the distance between the point and the pencil matches the length of the base (8 cm). You can use a ruler to ensure accuracy.

#### **3. Draw Arcs from Points A and B**
- Place the compass point on **A** and draw an arc above the line segment AB.
- Without changing the compass width, place the compass point on **B** and draw another arc above the line segment AB.
- The two arcs should intersect at a single point above the line segment. Label this intersection point as **C**.

#### **4. Connect Points A, B, and C**
- Use your straightedge to draw straight lines connecting:
  - Point **A** to point **C**.
  - Point **B** to point **C**.
- These lines will form the other two sides of the equilateral triangle.

#### **5. Verify the Triangle**
- Measure the lengths of all three sides of the triangle using a ruler to confirm that each side is exactly **8 cm**.
- Additionally, you can verify that all three angles are **60°**, which is a defining property of equilateral triangles.

---

### **Why This Works**
- An equilateral triangle has all three sides of equal length and all three angles equal to **60°**.
- By drawing arcs with the same radius (equal to the side length) from both endpoints of the base, the intersection point ensures that the third vertex is equidistant from both endpoints, satisfying the conditions for an equilateral triangle.

---

### **Final Answer**
You have successfully constructed an equilateral triangle with side lengths of **8 cm** using a compass and straightedge. The key steps involve creating arcs with the compass and connecting the points to form the triangle. 

**Boxed Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\text{An equilateral triangle with side length 8 cm is constructed by drawing arcs from both endpoints of the base and connecting the intersection point to the endpoints.}}

---

### Step 1: Draw the Circle
1. Place the compass point at $ A $ (the center of the circle).
2. Adjust the compass width to 5 cm.
3. Draw the circle by rotating the compass around $ A $. This will create a circle with radius 5 cm centered at $ A $.

---

### Step 2: Mark Point $ B $ on the Circumference
1. Choose any point on the circumference of the circle and label it as $ B $. You can do this by placing the tip of the compass or straightedge anywhere along the circle's edge.

---

### Step 3: Draw the Radius $ AB $
1. Use the straightedge to draw a straight line connecting $ A $ (the center) to $ B $ (the point on the circumference). This line is the radius $ AB $.

---

### Step 4: Construct the Perpendicular Line at $ B $
The tangent line at point $ B $ must be perpendicular to the radius $ AB $. To construct this perpendicular line, follow these steps:

#### Substep 4.1: Create an Arc Above and Below $ AB $
1. Place the compass point at $ B $ and adjust the compass width to a convenient length (greater than half the distance between $ A $ and $ B $).
2. Draw an arc above the radius $ AB $ and another arc below $ AB $. These arcs should intersect the radius symmetrically.

#### Substep 4.2: Repeat the Process from Point $ A $
1. Without changing the compass width, place the compass point at $ A $.
2. Draw two more arcs that intersect the arcs drawn in Substep 4.1. Let the intersection points of these arcs be labeled as $ P $ (above $ AB $) and $ Q $ (below $ AB $).

#### Substep 4.3: Draw the Perpendicular Line
1. Use the straightedge to draw a straight line through points $ P $ and $ Q $. This line passes through $ B $ and is perpendicular to $ AB $.

---

### Step 5: Verify the Tangent Line
The line you just constructed through $ B $ is the tangent line to the circle at $ B $. By definition, a tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.

---

### Final Answer:
You have successfully constructed a tangent line to the circle at point $ B $ using only a straightedge and compass. The key geometric principle used here is that the tangent line is always perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.

"Space and form","Constructions and drawings","H","Using a protractor create a right triangle where one angle measures 45 degrees and the hypotenuse is 10 cm long; label all sides and angles appropriately.","To solve this task, you will need a protractor, a ruler, and a pencil. The goal is to construct a right triangle where one angle measures 45 degrees, the hypotenuse is 10 cm long, and all sides and angles are labeled appropriately. Here's how you can do it step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the properties of the triangle**
A right triangle with one angle measuring 45 degrees is a **45-45-90 triangle**. In such a triangle:
- The two non-right angles are equal (both 45 degrees).
- The two legs are congruent (equal in length).
- The relationship between the sides is given by the Pythagorean theorem or the specific ratio for a 45-45-90 triangle:
  \[
  \text{Leg} = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\sqrt{2}}
  \]

Given that the hypotenuse is 10 cm, the length of each leg can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Leg} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2} \, \text{cm}
\]
Approximately, \( 5\sqrt{2} \approx 7.07 \, \text{cm} \).

---

### **Step 2: Draw the base line**
1. Use your ruler to draw a horizontal line segment of any convenient length. This will serve as the starting point for constructing the triangle.
2. Mark a point on this line to act as the vertex of the right angle.

---

### **Step 3: Construct the 45-degree angle**
1. Place the center of the protractor on the marked vertex point.
2. Align the baseline of the protractor with the horizontal line you just drew.
3. Locate the 45-degree mark on the protractor and make a small dot at this position.
4. Remove the protractor and use your ruler to draw a straight line from the vertex through the dot you just made. This line represents one leg of the triangle.

---

### **Step 4: Draw the perpendicular line (right angle)**
1. Again, place the protractor on the same vertex point.
2. Locate the 90-degree mark on the protractor and make another small dot.
3. Remove the protractor and use your ruler to draw a straight line from the vertex through this new dot. This line represents the other leg of the triangle.

---

### **Step 5: Measure the hypotenuse**
1. Using your ruler, measure exactly 10 cm along the hypotenuse (the longest side of the triangle). Start from the vertex where the two legs meet and extend the line to this point.
2. Mark the endpoint of the 10 cm measurement.

---

### **Step 6: Complete the triangle**
1. Connect the endpoints of the two legs to form the triangle.
2. Double-check that the hypotenuse is indeed 10 cm and that the two legs are approximately 7.07 cm each.

---

### **Step 7: Label the sides and angles**
1. Label the hypotenuse as ""10 cm.""
2. Label each leg as approximately ""7.07 cm"" or \( 5\sqrt{2} \, \text{cm} \).
3. Label the angles:
   - The right angle as \( 90^\circ \).
   - The two equal angles as \( 45^\circ \).

---

### Final Triangle
Your triangle should now look like this:
- A right triangle with one angle measuring \( 45^\circ \), another angle measuring \( 45^\circ \), and the third angle measuring \( 90^\circ \).
- The hypotenuse is labeled as \( 10 \, \text{cm} \).
- Each leg is labeled as \( 7.07 \, \text{cm} \) or \( 5\sqrt{2} \, \text{cm} \).

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
A **quadrilateral** is any polygon with four sides. The task requires you to:
1. Draw three different quadrilaterals.
2. Ensure that each quadrilateral has a **distinct number of right angles** (i.e., no two quadrilaterals should have the same number of right angles).

Since a quadrilateral can have up to four right angles (as in the case of a rectangle or square), the distinct numbers of right angles could be **0, 1, and 2** or **0, 2, and 4**, depending on your choice.

---

### Step 2: Choose Quadrilaterals with Distinct Right Angles
Here’s how you can select three quadrilaterals with distinct numbers of right angles:

#### Quadrilateral 1: **Zero Right Angles**
- A quadrilateral with no right angles could be a **parallelogram** (excluding rectangles) or a **kite**.
- Example: Draw a parallelogram where none of the angles are 90°.
- Label it as ""Quadrilateral 1: Parallelogram (0 right angles).""

#### Quadrilateral 2: **One Right Angle**
- A quadrilateral with exactly one right angle is less common but possible. For example, you can draw an irregular quadrilateral where only one angle is 90°, and the other three angles are not.
- Label it as ""Quadrilateral 2: Irregular Quadrilateral (1 right angle).""

#### Quadrilateral 3: **Four Right Angles**
- A quadrilateral with four right angles is either a **rectangle** or a **square**.
- Example: Draw a rectangle (or a square, which is a special type of rectangle).
- Label it as ""Quadrilateral 3: Rectangle (4 right angles).""

---

### Step 3: Draw and Label the Quadrilaterals
Now that you’ve chosen the types of quadrilaterals, follow these steps to draw and label them:

1. **Draw Quadrilateral 1 (Parallelogram with 0 right angles):**
   - Draw two pairs of parallel sides.
   - Ensure none of the angles are 90°.
   - Label it clearly as ""Parallelogram (0 right angles).""

2. **Draw Quadrilateral 2 (Irregular Quadrilateral with 1 right angle):**
   - Draw a shape with four sides.
   - Make sure one angle is exactly 90°, and the other three angles are not.
   - Label it as ""Irregular Quadrilateral (1 right angle).""

3. **Draw Quadrilateral 3 (Rectangle with 4 right angles):**
   - Draw a rectangle (or square).
   - Ensure all four angles are 90°.
   - Label it as ""Rectangle (4 right angles).""

---

### Step 4: Verify Your Work
Double-check that:
- Each quadrilateral has a distinct number of right angles.
- The shapes are correctly labeled.

---

### Final Answer:
You now have three quadrilaterals:
1. **Parallelogram** (0 right angles),
2. **Irregular Quadrilateral** (1 right angle),
3. **Rectangle** (4 right angles).

"Space and form","Properties and relationships of figures and solids","D","Identify the number of angles in a hexagon and explain whether it is classified as an equiangular or non-equiangular shape based on your counting.","To solve this task, let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the properties of a hexagon
A **hexagon** is a polygon with six sides and six vertices (corners). By definition, every polygon has the same number of angles as it has sides. Therefore, a hexagon will have **6 angles**.

---

### Step 2: Classify the hexagon as equiangular or non-equiangular
An **equiangular polygon** is one in which all interior angles are equal. To determine whether the hexagon is equiangular, we need to consider the following:

#### Case 1: Regular Hexagon
- A **regular hexagon** is a special type of hexagon where all six sides are of equal length, and all six interior angles are also equal.
- The formula for calculating the measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon is:
  \[
  \text{Interior Angle} = \frac{(n - 2) \times 180^\circ}{n}
  \]
  where \( n \) is the number of sides.
- For a hexagon (\( n = 6 \)):
  \[
  \text{Interior Angle} = \frac{(6 - 2) \times 180^\circ}{6} = \frac{4 \times 180^\circ}{6} = 120^\circ
  \]
- Since all six angles in a regular hexagon are \( 120^\circ \), it is classified as an **equiangular shape**.

#### Case 2: Irregular Hexagon
- An **irregular hexagon** does not have all sides or angles equal. In this case, the interior angles can vary, and they may not all be \( 120^\circ \).
- If even one angle differs from the others, the hexagon is classified as **non-equiangular**.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion
1. A hexagon always has **6 angles**, regardless of whether it is regular or irregular.
2. Whether the hexagon is equiangular or non-equiangular depends on the specific properties of the hexagon:
   - If all six angles are equal (e.g., in a regular hexagon), it is **equiangular**.
   - If the angles are not all equal (e.g., in an irregular hexagon), it is **non-equiangular**.

If no additional information is provided about the hexagon, we assume it could be either regular or irregular. However, if the problem specifies that the hexagon is regular, then it is definitely **equiangular**.

---

\boxed{\text{A hexagon has 6 angles. It is equiangular if all angles are equal (e.g., in a regular hexagon), and non-equiangular otherwise.}}

Here, the length of the rectangle is \(8 \, \text{m}\) and the width is \(5 \, \text{m}\). Substituting these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Area of rectangle} = 8 \times 5 = 40 \, \text{m}^2
\]

So, the area of the rectangular garden is \(40 \, \text{m}^2\).

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the triangular flower bed
The formula for the area of a triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Here, the base of the triangle is \(4 \, \text{m}\) and the height is \(3 \, \text{m}\). Substituting these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \, \text{m}^2
\]

\[
\text{Total area} = \text{Area of rectangle} + \text{Area of triangle}
\]
\[
\text{Total area} = 40 + 6 = 46 \, \text{m}^2

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem
The patio consists of two sections:
1. A **square section** with sides measuring 6 feet.
2. A **rectangular section** with dimensions 4 feet by 3 feet.

The goal is to calculate the total area of the patio by summing up the areas of these two sections.

---

### Step 2: Recall the formulas for area
- The area of a square is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Area of square} = \text{side}^2
  \]
- The area of a rectangle is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
  \]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the square section

Let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The playground consists of:
1. A **rectangle** with dimensions 10 meters (length) by 5 meters (width).
2. A **semicircle** attached to one end of the rectangle, with a diameter of 4 meters.

The goal is to find the **total area** of the playground.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Rectangle
The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]

Substitute the given values:
\[
\text{Area of rectangle} = 10 \, \text{m} \times 5 \, \text{m} = 50 \, \text{m}^2
\]

So, the area of the rectangular part is **50 square meters**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Semicircle
The formula for the area of a circle is:
\[
\text{Area of circle} = \pi r^2
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

Since we are dealing with a **semicircle**, the area will be half of the area of a full circle:
\[
\text{Area of semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
\]

From the problem, the diameter of the semicircle is 4 meters. The radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:
\[
r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \, \text{m}
\]

Now substitute \( r = 2 \) into the formula for the area of the semicircle:
\[
\text{Area of semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (4) = 2\pi \, \text{m}^2
\]

Using an approximate value for \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
\[
\text{Area of semicircle} \approx 2 \times 3.14 = 6.28 \, \text{m}^2
\]

So, the area of the semicircular part is approximately **6.28 square meters**.

---

### Step 4: Add the Two Areas
The total area of the playground is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the semicircle:
\[
\text{Total area} = \text{Area of rectangle} + \text{Area of semicircle}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total area} = 50 \, \text{m}^2 + 6.28 \, \text{m}^2 = 56.28 \, \text{m}^2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The total area of the playground is approximately:

---

### Step 1: Understand the properties of a quadrilateral
A **quadrilateral** is any polygon with four sides. There are several types of quadrilaterals, such as squares, rectangles, rhombuses, parallelograms, trapezoids, and kites. Each type has specific properties that distinguish it from others.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the given properties
The problem specifies two key properties:
1. **Four right angles**: This means all interior angles of the quadrilateral are $90^\circ$.
2. **Opposite sides that are equal in length**: This means the lengths of the two pairs of opposite sides are the same.

---

### Step 3: Compare the properties to known quadrilaterals
Now, let’s examine which quadrilaterals satisfy these properties:

1. **Square**:
   - A square has four right angles.
   - Opposite sides of a square are equal in length (in fact, all sides are equal).
   - A square satisfies both conditions.

2. **Rectangle**:
   - A rectangle also has four right angles.
   - Opposite sides of a rectangle are equal in length.
   - A rectangle satisfies both conditions.

3. **Rhombus**:
   - A rhombus does not necessarily have four right angles (unless it is a square).
   - Opposite sides of a rhombus are equal in length, but this shape does not meet the ""four right angles"" condition unless it is a square.

4. **Parallelogram**:
   - A parallelogram does not necessarily have four right angles (unless it is a rectangle or square).
   - Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length, but this shape does not meet the ""four right angles"" condition unless it is a rectangle or square.

5. **Trapezoid**:
   - A trapezoid does not have four right angles (unless it is a special case like an isosceles trapezoid with additional constraints).
   - Opposite sides of a trapezoid are not necessarily equal in length.

6. **Kite**:
   - A kite does not have four right angles.
   - Opposite sides of a kite are not necessarily equal in length.

---

### Step 4: Determine the correct quadrilateral
From the analysis above, the only quadrilaterals that satisfy both conditions (four right angles and opposite sides equal in length) are the **square** and the **rectangle**.

- If the quadrilateral has all sides equal in length, it is a **square**.
- If the quadrilateral has opposite sides equal in length but not all sides equal, it is a **rectangle**.

---

### Final Answer:
The type of quadrilateral that has four right angles and opposite sides that are equal in length is either a **rectangle** or a **square**, depending on whether all sides are equal.

---

### Step 1: Understand the properties of a trapezoid
A **trapezoid** (or trapezium in some regions) is defined as a quadrilateral that has at least one pair of parallel sides. In terms of angles:
- If a quadrilateral has one pair of opposite sides that are parallel, then the angles adjacent to those sides will be supplementary (i.e., their sum will equal 180°).

Thus, to check if this quadrilateral is a trapezoid, we need to verify whether any pair of adjacent angles sums to 180°.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the given angles
The four angles of the quadrilateral are:
- 70°, 110°, 70°, and 110°.

Since the sum of all interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360°, we can confirm that these angles satisfy this condition:
$$
70^\circ + 110^\circ + 70^\circ + 110^\circ = 360^\circ.
$$

Now, let’s examine the pairs of adjacent angles to see if they are supplementary (sum to 180°):
1. $70^\circ + 110^\circ = 180^\circ$ ✅
2. $110^\circ + 70^\circ = 180^\circ$ ✅
3. $70^\circ + 110^\circ = 180^\circ$ ✅
4. $110^\circ + 70^\circ = 180^\circ$ ✅

All adjacent angle pairs are supplementary. This means that both pairs of opposite sides in this quadrilateral must be parallel.

---

### Step 3: Determine the type of quadrilateral
If both pairs of opposite sides are parallel, the quadrilateral is not just a trapezoid—it is actually a **parallelogram**. A parallelogram is a special type of trapezoid where both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.

---

### Final Answer:
The quadrilateral with angles 70°, 110°, 70°, and 110° **is a trapezoid**, but more specifically, it is a **parallelogram** because both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangular park
The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
\[

Here, the length of the park is \( 100 \) meters, and the width is \( 50 \) meters. Substituting these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Area of park} = 100 \times 50 = 5000 \, \text{square meters}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the triangular flower bed
The formula for the area of a triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
\]

Here, the base of the triangular flower bed is \( 30 \) meters, and the height is \( 20 \) meters. Substituting these values into the formula:

Let's break down the steps systematically.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We are working with a trapezoid where:
- The lengths of the two parallel sides (bases) are $ b_1 = 12 \, \text{cm} $ and $ b_2 = 8 \, \text{cm} $.
- The height of the trapezoid is $ h = 5 \, \text{cm} $.
- The trapezoid is divided into two triangles by one of its diagonals, and we are tasked with finding the length of that diagonal.

---

### **Step 2: Visualize the Trapezoid**
Let’s label the trapezoid as follows:
- The longer base $ AB = 12 \, \text{cm} $ lies at the bottom.
- The shorter base $ CD = 8 \, \text{cm} $ lies at the top.
- The height $ h = 5 \, \text{cm} $ is the perpendicular distance between the two bases.
- The diagonal $ AC $ divides the trapezoid into two triangles: $ \triangle ABC $ and $ \triangle ACD $.

Our goal is to calculate the length of the diagonal $ AC $.

---

### **Step 3: Break Down the Geometry**
The diagonal $ AC $ connects one vertex of the longer base ($ A $) to one vertex of the shorter base ($ C $). To compute its length, we need to analyze the geometry of the trapezoid.

#### **Key Observations:**
1. The trapezoid can be thought of as being composed of a rectangle in the middle and two right triangles on either side.
2. The difference in length between the two bases is $ b_1 - b_2 = 12 - 8 = 4 \, \text{cm} $. This difference is distributed equally on both sides of the trapezoid because it is symmetric. Thus, each right triangle has a horizontal leg of length $ \frac{b_1 - b_2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \, \text{cm} $.

#### **Coordinate System Setup:**
Place the trapezoid in a coordinate system for clarity:
- Let $ A = (0, 0) $ and $ B = (12, 0) $ (the longer base).
- Let $ D = (2, 5) $ and $ C = (10, 5) $ (the shorter base).

Now, the diagonal $ AC $ connects $ A(0, 0) $ to $ C(10, 5) $.

---

### **Step 4: Use the Distance Formula**
The length of the diagonal $ AC $ can be calculated using the distance formula:
$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.
$$

Here:
- $ A(0, 0) $ gives $ x_1 = 0 $, $ y_1 = 0 $,
- $ C(10, 5) $ gives $ x_2 = 10 $, $ y_2 = 5 $.

Substitute these values into the formula:
$$
AC = \sqrt{(10 - 0)^2 + (5 - 0)^2}.
$$

Simplify:
$$
AC = \sqrt{10^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{100 + 25} = \sqrt{125}.
$$

Simplify further:
$$
AC = \sqrt{125} = 5\sqrt{5}.

The length of the diagonal $ AC $ is:

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between an exterior angle and its opposite interior angles
In any triangle:
- An **exterior angle** is equal to the sum of the two **opposite interior angles** of the triangle.
  
For example, if you have a triangle with angles $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $, and you extend one side of the triangle to form an exterior angle at vertex $ C $, then:
$$
\text{Exterior angle at } C = A + B
$$

### Step 2: Write down the given information
From the problem:
- The exterior angle measures $ 120^\circ $.
- One of the opposite interior angles measures $ 45^\circ $.

Let the other opposite interior angle be $ x $. According to the property mentioned in Step 1:
$$
\text{Exterior angle} = \text{Sum of the two opposite interior angles}
$$
Substituting the known values:
$$
120^\circ = 45^\circ + x
$$

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $
Rearrange the equation to isolate $ x $:
$$
x = 120^\circ - 45^\circ
$$
$$
x = 75^\circ

### Step 4: Verify the solution
The sum of the two opposite interior angles should equal the exterior angle. Here:

### Step 1: Understand the properties of a polygon
A polygon with five sides is called a **pentagon**. The sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
\]

where \( n \) is the number of sides of the polygon.

For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

So, the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).

---

### Step 2: Account for the given angles
We are told that three of the interior angles are each \( 90^\circ \). Therefore, the sum of these three angles is:

\[
90^\circ + 90^\circ + 90^\circ = 270^\circ
\]

This means the remaining two angles must account for the rest of the total angle sum, which is:

\[
540^\circ - 270^\circ = 270^\circ
\]

Thus, the sum of the remaining two angles is \( 270^\circ \).

---

### Step 3: Solve for the remaining two angles
Let the measures of the two unknown angles be \( x \) and \( y \). From the above calculation, we know:

\[
x + y = 270^\circ
\]

Without additional information about the specific type of pentagon (e.g., whether it is regular or irregular), there are infinitely many possible pairs of values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this equation. For example:
- If \( x = 135^\circ \), then \( y = 135^\circ \).
- If \( x = 100^\circ \), then \( y = 170^\circ \).
- And so on.

However, if the pentagon is **regular**, all interior angles would be equal, but this contradicts the given condition that three angles are \( 90^\circ \). Therefore, the pentagon must be **irregular**.

### Final Answer:
The measures of the remaining two angles depend on the specific configuration of the pentagon. However, their sum is always:

   \text{Total area for this pair} = 2 \cdot 12 = 24 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

2. **Face 2**: Two faces with dimensions \(L \times H\) (length × height)
   \[
   \text{Area of one face} = L \cdot H = 4 \cdot 5 = 20 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
   Since there are two such faces:
   \[
   \text{Total area for this pair} = 2 \cdot 20 = 40 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

3. **Face 3**: Two faces with dimensions \(W \times H\) (width × height)
   \[
   \text{Area of one face} = W \cdot H = 3 \cdot 5 = 15 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
   Since there are two such faces:
   \[
   \text{Total area for this pair} = 2 \cdot 15 = 30 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

#### Step 3: Add the areas of all pairs of faces
Now, sum up the total areas of all three pairs of faces:
\[
\text{Surface Area} = 24 + 40 + 30 = 94 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
The surface area of the rectangular prism is:
\[
\boxed{94 \, \text{cm}^2}

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]

Where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circular base,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder,
- \( \pi \) (pi) is approximately 3.14159.

### Step-by-step Solution:

"Space and form","Properties and relationships of figures and solids","G","Determine the total surface area of a cylinder that has a radius of 6 inches and a height of 10 inches including the areas of both circular bases.","To determine the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to account for all the surfaces that make up the shape. A cylinder consists of three parts:

1. **Two circular bases** (top and bottom).
2. **A rectangular side** (the lateral surface when ""unwrapped"").

The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is given by:

\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
\]

Where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circular base.
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.
- \( \pi \) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the given values
From the problem:
- Radius (\( r \)) = 6 inches
- Height (\( h \)) = 10 inches

#### Step 2: Calculate the area of the two circular bases
The area of one circular base is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of one base} = \pi r^2
\]
Substitute \( r = 6 \):
\[
\text{Area of one base} = \pi (6)^2 = \pi \cdot 36 = 36\pi \, \text{square inches}
\]

Since there are two bases, their combined area is:
\[
\text{Area of both bases} = 2 \cdot 36\pi = 72\pi \, \text{square inches}
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the lateral surface area
The lateral surface area is the area of the rectangle that wraps around the cylinder. Its formula is:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh
\]
Substitute \( r = 6 \) and \( h = 10 \):
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi (6)(10) = 2\pi \cdot 60 = 120\pi \, \text{square inches}
\]

#### Step 4: Add the areas together
The total surface area is the sum of the areas of the two bases and the lateral surface:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Area of both bases} + \text{Lateral Surface Area}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 72\pi + 120\pi = 192\pi \, \text{square inches}
\]

#### Step 5: Approximate the result (if needed)
If you want a numerical approximation, use \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 192 \cdot 3.14159 = 603.18576 \, \text{square inches}

"Space and form","Properties and relationships of figures and solids","H","In triangle ABC if angle A = angle D and the lengths of side AB = 6 cm and side DE = 9 cm determine the length of side AC if triangle ABC is similar to triangle ADE.","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of **similar triangles**. When two triangles are similar, their corresponding angles are equal, and the ratios of the lengths of their corresponding sides are equal.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information
We are told:
1. Triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is similar to triangle $ \triangle ADE $.
2. $ \angle A = \angle D $ (this is explicitly stated).
3. The length of side $ AB = 6 \, \text{cm} $.
4. The length of side $ DE = 9 \, \text{cm} $.

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides in $ \triangle ABC $ and $ \triangle ADE $ will be constant.

---

### Step 2: Identify the corresponding sides
From the similarity of the triangles:
- Side $ AB $ in $ \triangle ABC $ corresponds to side $ AD $ in $ \triangle ADE $.
- Side $ AC $ in $ \triangle ABC $ corresponds to side $ AE $ in $ \triangle ADE $.
- Side $ BC $ in $ \triangle ABC $ corresponds to side $ DE $ in $ \triangle ADE $.

Thus, the ratio of corresponding sides can be written as:
$$
\frac{\text{side in } \triangle ABC}{\text{corresponding side in } \triangle ADE} = \text{constant}.
$$

---

### Step 3: Set up the proportion using the given sides
We know that $ AB = 6 \, \text{cm} $ and $ DE = 9 \, \text{cm} $. Since $ DE $ corresponds to $ BC $, we can write:
$$
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{DE}.
$$

However, since $ AB $ and $ DE $ are not directly related, let’s focus on the ratio involving $ AC $ and $ AE $. Let the length of $ AC $ be $ x $. Then:
$$
\frac{AC}{AE} = \frac{AB}{AD}.
$$

But note that $ AD $ is the same as $ AB $ because they correspond to each other in the similarity relationship. Thus:
$$
\frac{AC}{AE} = \frac{6}{9}.
$$

Simplify the ratio:
$$
\frac{AC}{AE} = \frac{2}{3}.
$$

This means that the length of $ AC $ is $ \frac{2}{3} $ of the length of $ AE $.

---

### Step 4: Solve for $ AC $
Let the length of $ AE $ be some value $ y $. Then:
$$
AC = \frac{2}{3} \cdot AE.
$$

If no further information about $ AE $ is provided, the length of $ AC $ depends on $ AE $. However, if additional constraints or values for $ AE $ are given, you can substitute them into this equation to find the exact value of $ AC $.

---

### Final Answer:
The length of $ AC $ is proportional to $ AE $, with the relationship:
$$
\boxed{AC = \frac{2}{3} \cdot AE}.

"Space and form","Properties and relationships of figures and solids","H","Two triangles PQR and STU are similar with corresponding sides PR = 10 cm and TU = 15 cm find the length of side PQ if ST = 12 cm.","To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the situation step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the properties of similar triangles
When two triangles are similar, their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional. This means that the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides in one triangle is equal to the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides in the other triangle.

In this case:
- Triangle \( PQR \) is similar to triangle \( STU \).
- The corresponding sides are:
  - \( PR \) corresponds to \( TU \),
  - \( PQ \) corresponds to \( ST \),
  - \( QR \) corresponds to \( SU \).

### Step 2: Write down the given information
From the problem:
- \( PR = 10 \, \text{cm} \)
- \( TU = 15 \, \text{cm} \)
- \( ST = 12 \, \text{cm} \)

We need to find the length of side \( PQ \).

### Step 3: Set up the proportionality relationship
Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. Therefore:
\[
\frac{PQ}{ST} = \frac{PR}{TU}
\]

Substitute the known values into the equation:
\[
\frac{PQ}{12} = \frac{10}{15}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( PQ \)
Simplify the fraction on the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{PQ}{12} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to isolate \( PQ \):
\[
PQ = 12 \cdot \frac{2}{3}
\]

Simplify:
\[
PQ = \frac{24}{3} = 8
\]

### Final Answer:
The length of side \( PQ \) is:

"Space and form","Properties and relationships of figures and solids","H","If triangle XYZ is similar to triangle ABC with XY = 5 m BC = 15 m and the length of side XZ is missing calculate the value of XZ.","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step and use the properties of similar triangles.

### Step 1: Understand the property of similar triangles
When two triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. This means that the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides in one triangle is equal to the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides in the other triangle.

For example, if triangle \( XYZ \) is similar to triangle \( ABC \), then:
\[
\frac{XY}{AB} = \frac{YZ}{BC} = \frac{XZ}{AC}
\]

### Step 2: Identify the given information
From the problem, we know:
- \( XY = 5 \, \text{m} \)
- \( BC = 15 \, \text{m} \)
- \( XZ \) is the missing side we need to calculate.

We also know that triangle \( XYZ \) is similar to triangle \( ABC \). However, the problem does not explicitly provide the length of \( AC \), the side corresponding to \( XZ \). Without this value, we cannot directly compute \( XZ \).

### Step 3: Use the proportionality relationship
Let’s assume \( AC \) (the side in triangle \( ABC \) corresponding to \( XZ \)) has a known or calculable value. Then, using the similarity property:
\[
\frac{XY}{AB} = \frac{XZ}{AC}
\]

Rewriting for \( XZ \):
\[
XZ = AC \cdot \frac{XY}{AB}
\]

Here, \( AB \) is the side in triangle \( ABC \) corresponding to \( XY \). If \( AB \) is provided, we can substitute all known values into this formula.

### Step 4: Check if additional information is available
If the problem provides the length of \( AC \) or \( AB \), substitute those values into the formula. For instance:
- Suppose \( AB = 10 \, \text{m} \) and \( AC = 30 \, \text{m} \).
- Then, the ratio \( \frac{XY}{AB} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \).

Using the proportionality:
\[
XZ = AC \cdot \frac{XY}{AB} = 30 \cdot 0.5 = 15 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the length of \( XZ \) would be \( 15 \, \text{m} \).

### Final Answer:
The value of \( XZ \) depends on the lengths of \( AB \) and \( AC \). If these are given as \( AB = 10 \, \text{m} \) and \( AC = 30 \, \text{m} \), then:
\[
\boxed{XZ = 15 \, \text{m}}
\]

If \( AB \) or \( AC \) are not provided, you will need clarification or additional data to proceed further."

### Step 1: Understand the Task
The goal is to make the butterfly's wings symmetrical. This means that the right wing should be a mirror image of the left wing, with the center line acting as the axis of symmetry.

### Step 2: Identify Key Features of the Left Wing
- Carefully examine the left wing of the butterfly.
- Identify all the key features such as patterns, curves, lines, and colors on the left wing.
- Note the positions of these features relative to the center line.

### Step 3: Use the Center Line as the Axis of Symmetry
- The center line divides the butterfly into two halves. 
- Any point or feature on the left wing must have a corresponding point or feature on the right wing at an equal distance from the center line but on the opposite side.

### Step 4: Reflect the Left Wing Across the Center Line
- For each feature (e.g., a curve, dot, or pattern) on the left wing:
  - Measure its distance from the center line.
  - Draw the same feature on the right wing at the same distance from the center line but on the opposite side.
  - Ensure that the orientation of the feature is mirrored. For example, if a curve opens to the right on the left wing, it should open to the left on the right wing.

### Step 5: Check for Symmetry
- Once you’ve drawn the right wing, compare it to the left wing.
- Make sure every element on the left wing has a corresponding, mirrored element on the right wing.
- Adjust any discrepancies to ensure perfect symmetry.

### Step 6: Add Final Touches
- If the butterfly has colors or shading, replicate these on the right wing to match the left wing.
- Ensure that the overall appearance of the butterfly is balanced and visually appealing.

### Tools You Can Use:
- **Ruler**: To measure distances accurately from the center line.
- **Tracing Paper** (optional): If available, you can trace the left wing and flip the tracing paper over the center line to help draw the right wing.
- **Lightbox or Window** (optional): Place the drawing on a lightbox or against a window and use the reflection to guide your drawing.

By following these steps, you will successfully complete the butterfly drawing with symmetrical wings."

### Step 1: Understand the Line of Symmetry
The line of symmetry is an imaginary vertical line that divides the heart into two equal halves. Anything on one side of this line should be mirrored exactly on the other side.

### Step 2: Examine the Given Half
Carefully observe the half of the heart that is already drawn. Pay attention to its curves, angles, and proportions. This will help you replicate it accurately on the other side.

### Step 3: Place Your Drawing Tools
Position your pencil or drawing tool so that you can draw the mirrored image of the given half. It might help to lightly sketch the line of symmetry if it’s not already visible, as this will serve as a guide.

### Step 4: Start Mirroring the Shape
Begin at the topmost point where the heart's curve starts (near the ""valley"" between the two lobes of the heart). From there:
- **Follow the curve**: As you trace along the edge of the given half, imagine how the same curve would look on the opposite side.
- **Maintain symmetry**: Ensure that every part of the new half matches the corresponding part on the original half in terms of distance from the line of symmetry.

### Step 5: Complete the Bottom Part
Once you’ve mirrored the upper curves, move to the bottom part of the heart (the pointed tip). Again, ensure that the angle and length of the line are symmetrical with respect to the line of symmetry.

### Step 6: Check for Accuracy
After completing the second half, compare both sides to confirm they are identical. You can fold the paper along the line of symmetry or use a mirror placed along the line to verify that the two halves align perfectly.

### Tips for Success:
- Use light strokes initially so you can make adjustments if needed.
- Break the heart into smaller sections (e.g., the top left curve, the bottom left line) and tackle each section individually before connecting them all together.
- Practice makes perfect—don’t worry if your first attempt isn’t flawless; keep refining until you achieve symmetry.

By following these steps, you’ll successfully complete the heart shape while maintaining its symmetry!"

---

### **1. Understand Symmetry**
Symmetry in this context means that the star's points should be evenly distributed around its center. This ensures that the star looks identical when rotated by specific angles or reflected across certain axes.

For a star with \( n \)-points:
- The angle between consecutive points is \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \).
- Each point should extend outward from the center at equal distances and angles.

---

### **2. Analyze the Given Design**
Carefully examine the partially completed star:
- Identify how many points are already drawn.
- Determine the total number of points the star is intended to have (e.g., 5-pointed, 6-pointed, etc.).
- Observe the angles and lengths of the existing points to maintain consistency when adding new ones.

---

### **3. Calculate Missing Points**
If the star has \( k \) points already drawn and the total number of points is \( n \), then the number of missing points is \( n - k \).

#### Example:
- If you have a partially completed 5-pointed star with 3 points drawn, you need to add \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) more points.

---

### **4. Draw the Missing Points**
Follow these steps to add the missing points:

#### **Step 1: Locate the Center**
Ensure you know the exact center of the star. This is crucial for maintaining symmetry.

#### **Step 2: Measure Angles**
- Use a protractor to measure the angle between consecutive points of the existing star.
- For an \( n \)-pointed star, the angle between consecutive points is \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \).

#### **Step 3: Mark New Points**
- Starting from the last drawn point, rotate by \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \) to find the position of the next point.
- Repeat this process until all missing points are marked.

#### **Step 4: Draw the Points**
- Extend lines from the center to the marked positions to complete the star.
- Ensure the length of each new point matches the length of the existing points for uniformity.

---

### **5. Verify Symmetry**
Once the star is complete:
- Check if all points are equidistant from the center.
- Confirm that the angles between consecutive points are consistent.
- Rotate the star mentally or physically by \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \). If it looks identical after each rotation, the symmetry is correct.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
Suppose you are given a partially completed 6-pointed star with 3 points already drawn.

1. **Determine the total number of points**: \( n = 6 \).
2. **Calculate missing points**: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \).
3. **Measure the angle**: \( \frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ \).
4. **Add missing points**:
   - Start from the last drawn point.
   - Rotate \( 60^\circ \) clockwise or counterclockwise to locate the next point.
   - Repeat until all 3 missing points are added.
5. **Verify symmetry**: Ensure all points are evenly spaced and of equal length.

Here's how you can approach it step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand Tessellation**
A tessellation is a pattern of shapes that fit together without gaps or overlaps, covering an entire plane. The shapes used in the tessellation must be congruent (same size and shape) but can vary in orientation.

---

### **Step 2: Choose Three Different Shapes**
Select three different geometric shapes that can tessellate. Common shapes that tessellate include:
- Triangles
- Squares
- Hexagons
- Parallelograms
- Trapezoids

For this task, ensure all three shapes are congruent (same size and dimensions). For example:
- Equilateral triangles
- Squares
- Regular hexagons

Alternatively, you could use irregular polygons as long as they tessellate properly.

---

### **Step 3: Arrange the Shapes**
1. **Start with one shape**: Begin by drawing one of your chosen shapes on paper or using digital tools.
2. **Add the second shape**: Place the second shape next to the first, ensuring there are no gaps or overlaps.
3. **Integrate the third shape**: Add the third shape into the pattern, making sure it fits seamlessly with the others.
4. **Repeat the pattern**: Continue arranging the shapes in a repeating sequence until the entire area is covered.

**Tip**: Experiment with rotations, reflections, and translations of the shapes to create interesting patterns.

---

### **Step 4: Color the Shapes**
Once your tessellation is complete, enhance the design by coloring each shape differently:
1. Assign a unique color to each of the three shapes.
2. Ensure the colors contrast enough to make the pattern visually appealing.
3. Be consistent with the color assignment throughout the tessellation.

---

### **Step 5: Refine Your Design**
- Check for any gaps or overlaps in the tessellation.
- Adjust the arrangement if necessary to ensure the shapes fit perfectly.
- Use symmetry or asymmetry creatively to add interest to your design.

---

### **Optional: Digital Tools**
If you prefer working digitally, you can use software like:
- Adobe Illustrator
- GeoGebra
- Microsoft Paint
- Online tessellation generators

These tools allow you to easily manipulate shapes and colors.

---

### **Example**
Suppose you choose:
1. Equilateral triangles (blue)
2. Squares (red)
3. Regular hexagons (green)

You could arrange them so that:
- A triangle touches one side of a square.
- A hexagon fills the space between two squares and two triangles.
- Repeat this pattern across the plane.

Color each shape consistently (e.g., all triangles blue, all squares red, all hexagons green).

---

### **Final Output**
Your completed tessellation should:
1. Cover the entire plane without gaps or overlaps.
2. Use at least three different congruent shapes.
3. Feature distinct colors for each shape.

This process allows you to create a visually striking and mathematically sound design! 

**Boxed Answer:**  
To solve the task, select three congruent shapes that tessellate, arrange them in a repeating pattern without gaps or overlaps, and color each shape differently to enhance the design."
"Space and form","Symmetries and illustrations","D","Design a floor plan for a room using congruent hexagonal tiles ensuring that the entire floor is covered without any gaps or overlaps.","To design a floor plan using congruent hexagonal tiles that cover the entire floor without gaps or overlaps, you need to understand the geometric properties of hexagons and how they tessellate. Below is a step-by-step explanation of how to approach this task:

---

### Step 1: Understand Hexagonal Tessellation
Hexagons are one of the three regular polygons (along with squares and equilateral triangles) that can tessellate a plane without leaving gaps or creating overlaps. This property arises because the interior angle of a regular hexagon is $120^\circ$, and three hexagons meeting at a point perfectly fill the $360^\circ$ around that point.

---

### Step 2: Determine the Room Dimensions
- Measure the dimensions of the room (length and width).
- Ensure these dimensions are compatible with the size of the hexagonal tiles. For example, if the side length of each hexagon is $s$, the distance between opposite sides of the hexagon (its height) is $h = \sqrt{3} \cdot s$, and the horizontal distance between adjacent hexagons in a row is $2s$.

---

### Step 3: Arrange the Tiles in Rows
Hexagonal tiles are typically arranged in staggered rows:
1. Place the first row of hexagons along one wall, ensuring their edges align with the wall.
2. Start the second row by offsetting it so that the vertices of the hexagons in the second row sit in the gaps between the hexagons in the first row.
3. Repeat this pattern for subsequent rows until the entire floor is covered.

This arrangement ensures that the tiles fit together seamlessly without gaps or overlaps.

---

### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Tiles Needed
To calculate the number of tiles required:
1. Compute the area of one hexagonal tile. The formula for the area of a regular hexagon with side length $s$ is:
   $$
   A_{\text{hex}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot s^2
   $$
2. Compute the total area of the room ($A_{\text{room}}$).
3. Divide the room's area by the area of one tile to determine the number of tiles needed:
   $$
   N = \frac{A_{\text{room}}}{A_{\text{hex}}}
   $$
   Round up to the nearest whole number since partial tiles cannot be used.

---

### Step 5: Handle Edge Cases
If the room's dimensions do not perfectly match the tessellation pattern:
1. Cut tiles as needed to fit along the edges or corners of the room.
2. Use a saw or tile cutter to trim the hexagons to the required size and shape.

---

### Step 6: Verify the Layout
Before installing the tiles, create a layout diagram or use graph paper to simulate the arrangement. Ensure that the pattern aligns correctly with the room's dimensions and that there are no gaps or overlaps.

---

### Final Notes
By following these steps, you can successfully design a floor plan using congruent hexagonal tiles. The key is leveraging the tessellation properties of hexagons and carefully planning the layout to accommodate the room's dimensions.

If you have specific dimensions for the room or the tiles, feel free to provide them, and I can help refine the calculations further!"

---

### **Step 4: Draw the Base Grid**
1. **Using Squares**:
   - Begin by drawing a grid of squares across the paper. Ensure the squares are evenly spaced and aligned horizontally and vertically.
   - This will serve as the foundation for your tessellation.

2. **Adding Triangles**:
   - Divide each square into two right triangles by drawing a diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner.
   - Alternatively, you can place equilateral triangles between the squares to create a mixed pattern.

---

### **Step 5: Create a Pattern**
1. **Option 1: Alternating Squares and Triangles**:
   - Start with a row of squares.
   - In the next row, alternate between half-squares (triangles) and full squares.
   - Repeat this pattern, ensuring that the shapes interlock seamlessly.

2. **Option 2: Using Equilateral Triangles**:
   - Draw rows of equilateral triangles, ensuring that their vertices meet at points.
   - Insert squares where four triangle corners meet to fill gaps.

3. **Option 3: Combining Shapes Creatively**:
   - Experiment with different arrangements, such as placing triangles inside squares or surrounding squares with triangles.
   - Ensure that all shapes fit together without gaps or overlaps.

---

### **Step 6: Check for Continuity**

"Space and form","Symmetries and illustrations","E","Draw all the lines of symmetry for a regular hexagon and explain how you determined their positions.","To solve the task of drawing all the lines of symmetry for a regular hexagon and explaining how their positions are determined, let's break it down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand what a line of symmetry is**
A line of symmetry divides a shape into two identical parts such that one part is the mirror image of the other. For a regular polygon like a hexagon, these lines pass through specific points or edges to ensure symmetry.

---

### **Step 2: Recognize the properties of a regular hexagon**
A regular hexagon has:
- **6 equal sides**.
- **6 equal angles** (each angle is \(120^\circ\)).
- It is highly symmetrical, meaning it has multiple lines of symmetry.

---

### **Step 3: Determine the number of lines of symmetry**
For any regular polygon with \(n\) sides:
- The number of lines of symmetry is equal to \(n\).
Thus, a regular hexagon has **6 lines of symmetry**.

---

### **Step 4: Identify the positions of the lines of symmetry**
The lines of symmetry in a regular hexagon can be divided into two types:
1. **Lines passing through opposite vertices**: These lines connect two opposite corners of the hexagon.
2. **Lines passing through the midpoints of opposite sides**: These lines run perpendicular to the sides of the hexagon and bisect them.

#### How to determine their positions:
- Start by labeling the vertices of the hexagon as \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) in clockwise or counterclockwise order.
- Draw the first type of line by connecting vertex \(A\) to vertex \(D\) (opposite vertices). Similarly, draw lines connecting \(B\) to \(E\) and \(C\) to \(F\).
- Draw the second type of line by connecting the midpoint of side \(AB\) to the midpoint of side \(DE\). Similarly, draw lines connecting the midpoints of \(BC\) to \(EF\) and \(CD\) to \(FA\).

---

### **Step 5: Draw the lines of symmetry**
Using the above information, you can now draw the 6 lines of symmetry on the hexagon:
1. Three lines pass through opposite vertices (\(A-D\), \(B-E\), \(C-F\)).
2. Three lines pass through the midpoints of opposite sides.

---

### **Step 6: Verify symmetry**
To confirm that these lines are indeed lines of symmetry:
- Fold the hexagon along each line. If the two halves perfectly overlap, the line is a valid line of symmetry.

---

### **Final Answer**
A regular hexagon has **6 lines of symmetry**:
- **3 lines** pass through opposite vertices.
- **3 lines** pass through the midpoints of opposite sides.

These lines divide the hexagon into congruent parts, ensuring perfect symmetry. 

**Boxed Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\text{A regular hexagon has 6 lines of symmetry: 3 through opposite vertices and 3 through the midpoints of opposite sides.}}

---

### Step 1: Understand what a line of symmetry is
A **line of symmetry** is an imaginary line that divides a shape into two identical halves, such that one half is the mirror image of the other. If you were to fold the shape along this line, the two halves would perfectly overlap.

---

### Step 2: Recall the properties of a regular pentagon
A **regular pentagon** is a five-sided polygon where:
- All sides are of equal length.
- All interior angles are equal (each angle measures $108^\circ$).

Because it is ""regular,"" it has a high degree of symmetry.

---

### Step 3: Determine if the pentagon has lines of symmetry
A regular pentagon has **five lines of symmetry**. These lines pass through:
1. A vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side.
2. Each line divides the pentagon into two congruent parts.

This happens because the pentagon is symmetric about these axes due to its regularity.

---

### Step 4: Illustrate the lines of symmetry
To illustrate the lines of symmetry on a diagram:
1. Draw a regular pentagon. Label the vertices as $A, B, C, D, E$, going clockwise or counterclockwise.
2. Draw the five lines of symmetry:
   - One line from vertex $A$ to the midpoint of the opposite side ($DE$).
   - One line from vertex $B$ to the midpoint of the opposite side ($EA$).
   - One line from vertex $C$ to the midpoint of the opposite side ($AB$).
   - One line from vertex $D$ to the midpoint of the opposite side ($BC$).
   - One line from vertex $E$ to the midpoint of the opposite side ($CD$).

Each of these lines will divide the pentagon into two mirror-image halves.

---

### Step 5: Verify the symmetry
To confirm that these are indeed lines of symmetry:
- Fold the pentagon along each drawn line. The two halves should perfectly overlap.
- Alternatively, imagine rotating the pentagon around its center by $72^\circ$ (since $360^\circ / 5 = 72^\circ$). After each rotation, the pentagon looks identical, confirming its symmetry.

---

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to do it:

### Step 1: Understand How a Balance Scale Works
A balance scale compares the weights of two objects by placing them on opposite sides of the scale. If one side is heavier, that side will go down, while the lighter side will rise. If both sides are equal in weight, the scale will remain balanced.

### Step 2: Place the Bags on the Scale
- Take the bag of oranges and place it on one side of the balance scale.
- Take the bag of apples and place it on the other side of the balance scale.

### Step 3: Observe the Result
- **If the side with the oranges goes down**: This means the bag of oranges is heavier than the bag of apples.
- **If the side with the apples goes down**: This means the bag of apples is heavier than the bag of oranges.
- **If the scale remains balanced**: This means both bags weigh the same.

### Step 4: Record Your Observation
Based on the result from the balance scale, you can conclude which bag has more weight:
- If the oranges' side is lower, say: ""The bag of oranges is heavier than the bag of apples.""
- If the apples' side is lower, say: ""The bag of apples is heavier than the bag of oranges.""
- If the scale is balanced, say: ""The bag of oranges weighs the same as the bag of apples.""

### Example Explanation:
Let’s assume you placed the bags on the scale and observed that the side with the oranges went down. You would explain your conclusion like this:
""The bag of oranges is heavier than the bag of apples because the side of the scale with the oranges sank lower than the side with the apples.""

By following these steps, you can accurately determine and explain which bag has more weight using a balance scale."

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We are given:
- A rectangular garden with dimensions **10 meters by 5 meters**.
- A path of **1 meter wide** surrounds the garden completely.

Our goal is to calculate the **total perimeter** of the garden including the path.

---

### Step 2: Visualize the Situation
The garden is surrounded by a 1-meter-wide path. This means the path adds an extra 1 meter on each side of the garden. As a result:
- The total length of the garden plus the path will increase by **2 meters** (1 meter added to each end of the length).
- Similarly, the total width of the garden plus the path will also increase by **2 meters** (1 meter added to each end of the width).

---

### Step 3: Adjust the Dimensions
The original dimensions of the garden are:
- Length = 10 meters
- Width = 5 meters

When we include the path:
- New length = Original length + 2 meters = 10 + 2 = **12 meters**

Let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the given shapes
- The **square patio** has sides of 4 feet each.
- The **rectangular area** measures 6 feet by 3 feet.

These two shapes are adjacent to each other, meaning they share a common boundary. This adjacency affects the total perimeter because the shared side is no longer part of the outer boundary.

---

### Step 2: Determine the shared side
The square and rectangle are adjacent, so they must share one side. Since the square has sides of 4 feet, the shared side must be one of the shorter sides of the rectangle (3 feet) if the rectangle is placed alongside the square. If the rectangle were placed such that its longer side (6 feet) aligns with the square, the dimensions would not match.

Thus, the shared side is **3 feet**, and this side will not contribute to the perimeter of the combined shape.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total perimeter
To find the perimeter of the combined shape, we add up all the outer edges, excluding the shared side.

#### Perimeter of the square:
The square has four sides, each measuring 4 feet. However, since one side of the square is shared with the rectangle, only three sides contribute to the perimeter:
\[
3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ feet}
\]

#### Perimeter of the rectangle:
The rectangle has two sides measuring 6 feet and two sides measuring 3 feet. However, one of the 3-foot sides is shared with the square, so only three sides contribute to the perimeter:
\[
6 + 6 + 3 = 15 \text{ feet}
\]

#### Total perimeter:
Now, we add the contributions from the square and the rectangle:
\[
12 + 15 = 27 \text{ feet}

### Step 1: Understand the dimensions of the swimming pool
The swimming pool is a rectangle with dimensions:
- Length = 8 meters
- Width = 4 meters

### Step 2: Account for the fence being 2 meters away from the pool on all sides
The fence surrounds the pool and is **2 meters away from the pool on all sides**. This means that the fenced area will extend 2 meters beyond the pool in every direction.

This additional distance affects both the length and the width of the fenced area:
- On each side of the pool (left and right), the fence extends 2 meters outward. So, the total added to the width is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) meters.
- Similarly, at the top and bottom of the pool, the fence also extends 2 meters outward. So, the total added to the length is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) meters.

- New length = Original length of the pool + 4 meters (2 meters on each side)
  \[
  \text{New length} = 8 + 4 = 12 \, \text{meters}
  \]
- New width = Original width of the pool + 4 meters (2 meters on each side)
  \[
  \text{New width} = 4 + 4 = 8 \, \text{meters}
  \]

So, the fenced area is a rectangle with dimensions:
- Length = 12 meters
- Width = 8 meters

### Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of the fenced area
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
\]

Substitute the values for the new length and width:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (12 + 8) = 2 \times 20 = 40 \, \text{meters}
\]

### Final Answer:
The perimeter of the fenced area is **40 meters**."

"Sizes and measurement","Recording and comparing quantities","H","A group of students recorded the heights of plants in centimeters after three weeks of growth: 15 22 18 25 and 20; calculate the average height and determine how much each height differs from the average.","To solve this task, we need to calculate the average height of the plants and then determine how much each individual plant's height differs from this average. Let me break this down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the given data
The recorded heights of the plants are:
$$ 15, 22, 18, 25, \text{and } 20 $$

These values represent the heights of the plants in centimeters.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the average height
The formula for the average (mean) is:
$$
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}
$$

#### Sum of all values:
$$
15 + 22 + 18 + 25 + 20 = 100
$$

#### Number of values:
There are 5 values in total.

"Sizes and measurement","Recording and comparing quantities","H","A survey of monthly water usage in three households shows usage of 150 180 and 210 liters; analyze the data to find the median and discuss what this reveals about the typical water consumption in these households.","To solve the task of finding the median and analyzing the data on monthly water usage, let's break it down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Data**
The given data represents the monthly water usage in three households:
- Household 1: 150 liters
- Household 2: 180 liters
- Household 3: 210 liters

This is a small dataset with only three values. The goal is to find the **median** and interpret what it reveals about typical water consumption.

---

### **Step 2: Arrange the Data in Ascending Order**
To calculate the median, the data must first be arranged in ascending order (from smallest to largest). The given data is already sorted:
\[ 150, 180, 210 \]

---

### **Step 3: Find the Median**
The **median** is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order. If there is an odd number of observations (as in this case), the median is the value that falls exactly in the middle.

Here, the three values are:
\[ 150, \mathbf{180}, 210 \]

The middle value is **180 liters**. Therefore, the median is:
\[
\text{Median} = 180 \, \text{liters}
\]

---

### **Step 4: Interpret the Median**
The median provides insight into the ""typical"" or central value of the dataset. In this case:
- The median water usage is **180 liters**, meaning that half of the households use less than or equal to 180 liters, and the other half use more than or equal to 180 liters.
- Since the dataset is small and evenly spaced, the median reflects the central tendency well. It suggests that **180 liters** is a representative amount of water usage for these households.

---

### **Step 5: Discuss the Typical Water Consumption**
The median of 180 liters indicates that the typical water consumption for these households is around this value. This measure is not influenced by extreme values (outliers), which makes it a robust statistic for describing the central tendency.

In this specific dataset:
- One household uses slightly less than the median (150 liters),
- One household matches the median exactly (180 liters),
- One household uses slightly more than the median (210 liters).

Thus, the median effectively captures the central value and provides a clear picture of the ""typical"" water usage in these households.

---

### **Final Answer**
The median water usage is:
\[
\boxed{180 \, \text{liters}}
\]

This reveals that the typical water consumption in these households is **180 liters per month**, with one household using less, one using exactly this amount, and one using more."

A rectangular prism has three pairs of opposite and congruent faces: the front and back, the top and bottom, and the left and right sides.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the dimensions of the rectangular prism**:
   - Length (\(l\)) = 5 cm
   - Width (\(w\)) = 3 cm
   - Height (\(h\)) = 4 cm

2. **Identify the formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism**:
   The surface area (\(SA\)) is given by:
   \[
   SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)
   \]
   Here:
   - \(lw\) is the area of the front and back faces.
   - \(lh\) is the area of the left and right faces.
   - \(wh\) is the area of the top and bottom faces.

3. **Calculate the area of each pair of faces**:

The task is to find the total surface area of a cylindrical container that includes both the top and bottom circular faces as well as the curved (lateral) surface.

### Step 1: Understand the formula for the total surface area of a cylinder
The total surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is the sum of:
1. The lateral (curved) surface area.
2. The areas of the two circular bases (top and bottom).

The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is:

\[
A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
\]

Where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circular base.
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.
- \( 2\pi r^2 \) is the combined area of the two circular bases.
- \( 2\pi rh \) is the lateral surface area.

### Step 2: Substitute the given values into the formula
From the problem, we know:
- \( r = 3 \, \text{cm} \)
- \( h = 10 \, \text{cm} \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[
A = 2\pi (3)^2 + 2\pi (3)(10)
\]

### Step 3: Simplify each term
First, calculate \( 2\pi r^2 \):
\[
2\pi (3)^2 = 2\pi (9) = 18\pi
\]

Next, calculate \( 2\pi rh \):
\[
2\pi (3)(10) = 2\pi (30) = 60\pi
\]

### Step 4: Add the two terms together
Now, add the results from the two calculations:
\[
A = 18\pi + 60\pi = 78\pi
\]

### Step 5: Provide the final answer
If you want the exact value in terms of \( \pi \), the total surface area is:

\[
\boxed{78\pi \, \text{cm}^2}

"Sizes and measurement","Calculating quantities","F","Determine the surface area of a composite shape made up of a cube with side length 6 cm and a hemisphere with a radius of 3 cm attached to the top.","To determine the surface area of the composite shape made up of a cube and a hemisphere, we need to carefully consider the contributions from each part of the shape while accounting for any overlaps or exclusions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the components of the composite shape**
1. **Cube**: The cube has a side length of \(6 \, \text{cm}\). Its total surface area would normally be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Surface Area of Cube} = 6 \times (\text{side length})^2 = 6 \times (6)^2 = 216 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
   However, since the hemisphere is attached to the top face of the cube, the top face of the cube will no longer contribute to the exposed surface area.

2. **Hemisphere**: The hemisphere has a radius of \(3 \, \text{cm}\). A full sphere's surface area is given by:
   \[
   \text{Surface Area of Sphere} = 4 \pi r^2
   \]
   Since the hemisphere is half of a sphere, its curved surface area is:
   \[
   \text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2 \pi r^2 = 2 \pi (3)^2 = 18 \pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
   Additionally, the flat circular base of the hemisphere coincides with the top face of the cube, so it does not contribute to the exposed surface area.

---

### **Step 2: Adjust for overlaps**
When the hemisphere is attached to the top face of the cube:
- The top face of the cube is covered by the flat base of the hemisphere. Therefore, the area of this face (\(6 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 36 \, \text{cm}^2\)) is excluded from the cube's surface area.
- The flat circular base of the hemisphere also does not contribute to the exposed surface area because it is in contact with the cube.

Thus, the total surface area of the composite shape is the sum of:
1. The surface area of the five visible faces of the cube.
2. The curved surface area of the hemisphere.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total surface area**
1. **Surface area of the five visible faces of the cube**:
   Since one face of the cube is covered, only five faces are exposed:
   \[
   \text{Exposed Surface Area of Cube} = 5 \times (\text{side length})^2 = 5 \times (6)^2 = 180 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

2. **Curved surface area of the hemisphere**:
   As calculated earlier:
   \[
   \text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 18 \pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

3. **Total surface area of the composite shape**:
   Adding the two contributions:
   \[
   \text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Exposed Surface Area of Cube} + \text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total Surface Area} = 180 + 18 \pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

---

### **Final Answer**
The total surface area of the composite shape is:
\[
\boxed{180 + 18\pi \, \text{cm}^2}
\] 

If you want an approximate numerical value, use \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):
\[
18 \pi \approx 18 \times 3.1416 = 56.5488
\]
So:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 180 + 56.5488 = 236.5488 \, \text{cm}^2

The Pythagorean Theorem states:

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

Where:
- \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two legs of the triangle,
- \(c\) is the hypotenuse (the longest side of the triangle).

In this problem:
- The ladder acts as the hypotenuse (\(c = 15\) feet),
- The distance from the base of the ladder to the wall is one leg of the triangle (\(a = 9\) feet),
- The height of the wall where the ladder touches it is the other leg of the triangle (\(b\)), which we need to find.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - Hypotenuse (\(c\)) = 15 feet,
   - One leg (\(a\)) = 9 feet.

2. **Substitute into the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   9^2 + b^2 = 15^2
   \]

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   Calculate \(9^2\) and \(15^2\):
   \[
   81 + b^2 = 225
   \]

4. **Isolate \(b^2\):**
   Subtract 81 from both sides:
   \[
   b^2 = 225 - 81
   \]
   \[
   b^2 = 144

5. **Solve for \(b\):**
   Take the square root of both sides:
   \[
   b = \sqrt{144}

   \[
   b = 12

### Final Answer:
The height of the wall where the ladder touches it is **12 feet**.

### Verification:
To ensure our solution is correct, check if the values satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem:
\[
9^2 + 12^2 = 15^2

"Sizes and measurement","Quantities in factual contexts","G","A rectangular garden has one side measuring 12 meters and a diagonal path that connects opposite corners; calculate the length of the diagonal path using the Pythagorean theorem.","To solve this problem, we will use the Pythagorean theorem, which is a fundamental principle in geometry. Let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We are given:
- A rectangular garden.
- One side of the rectangle measures **12 meters**.
- We need to calculate the length of the diagonal path that connects opposite corners.

The diagonal of a rectangle divides it into two right triangles. The diagonal acts as the hypotenuse of these triangles, while the sides of the rectangle are the other two legs of the triangle.

---

### Step 2: Recall the Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]
where:
- \( c \) is the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case),
- \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the two sides of the rectangle.

---

### Step 3: Assign Values
From the problem, one side of the rectangle is given as \( a = 12 \) meters. However, the length of the other side (\( b \)) is not provided. To proceed, we need the value of \( b \). If this value is missing, we cannot compute the diagonal directly.

If you can provide the length of the second side (\( b \)), we can continue with the calculation. For now, let’s assume \( b \) is known.

---

### Step 4: Substitute Known Values into the Formula
Once both \( a \) and \( b \) are known, substitute them into the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]

For example, if \( b = 5 \) meters (hypothetical value for illustration):
\[
c^2 = 12^2 + 5^2
\]
\[
c^2 = 144 + 25
\]
\[
c^2 = 169
\]

---

### Step 5: Solve for \( c \)
Take the square root of both sides to find \( c \):
\[
c = \sqrt{169}
\]
\[
c = 13 \, \text{meters}
\]

Thus, the length of the diagonal path would be **13 meters** in this example.

---

### Final Answer
If the second side \( b \) is provided, follow the same steps. The general formula for the diagonal is:
\[
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

If \( b \) is not specified, please provide its value so we can compute the exact diagonal length."

Where:
- \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two legs of the triangle,
- \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the given values**:
   - One leg (\(a\)) is 8 inches.
   - The hypotenuse (\(c\)) is 10 inches.
   - We need to find the length of the other leg (\(b\)).

2. **Substitute the known values into the Pythagorean Theorem**:
   \[
   8^2 + b^2 = 10^2
   \]

3. **Simplify the equation**:
   - Calculate \(8^2\) and \(10^2\):
     \[
     64 + b^2 = 100
     \]

4. **Isolate \(b^2\)**:
   - Subtract 64 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     b^2 = 100 - 64
     \]
     \[
     b^2 = 36
     \]

5. **Solve for \(b\)**:
   - Take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     b = \sqrt{36}
     \]
     \[
     b = 6
     \]

### Final Answer:
The length of the other leg is \(\boxed{6}\) inches.

---

### Verification:
To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \(a = 8\), \(b = 6\), and \(c = 10\) back into the Pythagorean Theorem:
\[
8^2 + 6^2 = 10^2
\]
\[
64 + 36 = 100

Let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the terms
- **Mean**: The average value of the numbers. It is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the total number of values.
- **Median**: The middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
- **Range**: The difference between the largest and smallest values.

---

### Step 2: Organize the data
The weights of the five athletes are:
$$ 72, 85, 78, 90, 65 $$

Arrange them in ascending order:
$$ 65, 72, 78, 85, 90 $$

---

Let's break it down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Data**
The monthly rainfall (in mm) for the last six months is:
\[ 120, 95, 110, 130, 140, 100 \]

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the Mean**
The **mean** is the average of all the data points. To calculate it:
1. Add up all the data points.
2. Divide the sum by the total number of data points.

#### Calculation:
Sum of the data points:
\[
120 + 95 + 110 + 130 + 140 + 100 = 695
\]

Number of data points:
\[
6
\]

Mean:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of data points}}{\text{Number of data points}} = \frac{695}{6} \approx 115.83 \, \text{mm}
\]

So, the mean is approximately **115.83 mm**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the Median**
The **median** is the middle value when the data points are arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.

"Sizes and measurement","Measuring and calculating","D","Use a protractor to measure the angle of the corner of your classroom desk and record the measurement in degrees.","To solve this task, you will need to use a protractor to measure the angle of the corner of your classroom desk and then record the measurement in degrees. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to do this:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Task**
The ""corner"" of the desk refers to the point where two edges of the desk meet, forming an angle. Most desks have square or rectangular corners, so the angle is likely to be close to 90 degrees (a right angle). However, some desks may have rounded or angled corners, so it's important to measure it directly.

---

### **Step 2: Gather Your Tools**
You will need:
- A protractor (a semicircular or circular tool marked with degree measurements).
- Optionally, a pencil or pen to mark points if needed.

---

### **Step 3: Position the Protractor**
1. Place the protractor on the desk so that its center point (usually marked with a small hole or crosshairs) aligns with the corner of the desk.
2. Ensure one edge of the desk lines up with the straight baseline of the protractor.

---

### **Step 4: Align the Protractor Properly**
- Make sure the protractor is flat against the surface of the desk.
- Double-check that one side of the corner (one edge of the desk) aligns with the baseline of the protractor.

---

### **Step 5: Read the Measurement**
1. Look at the second edge of the desk (the other side of the corner) and see where it intersects the curved edge of the protractor.
2. Follow the markings on the protractor to determine the angle in degrees. 
   - If the angle opens to the right, use the outer scale of the protractor.
   - If the angle opens to the left, use the inner scale of the protractor.

---

### **Step 6: Record the Measurement**
- Write down the angle measurement in degrees. For example, if the two edges of the desk form a perfect right angle, the measurement should be **90°**.
- If the desk has a slightly different shape, the angle might be slightly more or less than 90°.

---

### **Step 7: Verify Your Measurement**
- To ensure accuracy, you can repeat the process by repositioning the protractor or asking someone else to check your work.

---

### Example:
If the corner of your desk forms a perfect right angle, the measurement will be **90°**. If the desk has a slightly rounded or angled corner, the measurement might be something like **85°** or **95°**, depending on the design.

---

By following these steps, you can accurately measure and record the angle of the corner of your classroom desk!"
"Sizes and measurement","Measuring and calculating","D","Find an everyday object in your home such as a book or a picture frame and estimate the angle formed at one of its corners then verify your estimation using a protractor.","To solve this task, you will follow a systematic process of estimation and measurement. Here's how you can approach it step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Choose an Everyday Object**
Select an object in your home that has corners, such as:
- A book
- A picture frame
- A piece of paper
- A table or desk
- A windowpane

Make sure the object has clearly defined corners where angles are formed.

---

### **Step 2: Estimate the Angle**
1. **Visual Inspection**: Look at one of the corners of the object. Try to determine whether the angle is:
   - Less than 90° (acute angle)
   - Exactly 90° (right angle)
   - Greater than 90° but less than 180° (obtuse angle)
   - Exactly 180° (straight angle)

2. **Mental Estimation**: Based on your visual inspection, estimate the angle. For example:
   - If the corner looks like a typical square corner, it is likely close to 90°.
   - If the corner appears more open or closed, adjust your estimate accordingly.

3. **Record Your Estimate**: Write down your estimated angle value (e.g., ""I estimate the angle to be about 85°"").

---

### **Step 3: Verify Your Estimation Using a Protractor**
1. **Position the Protractor**:
   - Place the center point of the protractor exactly over the vertex (corner point) of the angle.
   - Align one side of the angle with the baseline of the protractor.

2. **Read the Measurement**:
   - Follow the other side of the angle up to the protractor's scale.
   - Read the value where the second side intersects the scale. Make sure you use the correct scale (inner or outer) depending on whether the angle is acute or obtuse.

3. **Compare with Your Estimate**:
   - Check how close your estimated angle was to the actual measured angle.
   - Note any discrepancies and think about why they might have occurred (e.g., perspective errors, misjudgment).

---

### **Step 4: Reflect on the Process**
After completing the task, reflect on the following questions:
- How accurate was your initial estimate?
- What factors might have influenced your estimation (e.g., lighting, object shape)?
- How could you improve your estimation skills for future attempts?

---

### Example Walkthrough:
Let’s say you choose a book:
1. **Estimate**: You look at the corner of the book and estimate the angle to be 90° because it looks like a perfect square corner.
2. **Measure**: Place the protractor on the corner of the book, align the baseline with one edge, and read the measurement. The protractor shows 92°.
3. **Compare**: Your estimate of 90° was very close to the actual measurement of 92°.

---

By following these steps, you can practice estimating angles and verifying them using a protractor. This exercise helps develop spatial awareness and improves your ability to make accurate estimations. 

**Final Answer**: To solve the task, choose an object, estimate its corner angle visually, measure it with a protractor, and compare the results."
"Sizes and measurement","Measuring and calculating","D","Identify and measure three different angles created by the hands of a clock at 3:00 6:00 and 9:00 using a protractor for accuracy.","To solve the task of identifying and measuring the angles created by the hands of a clock at 3:00, 6:00, and 9:00 using a protractor, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Clock and Its Angles
A clock is circular, and its face represents a full circle of 360 degrees. The hour hand and the minute hand form angles with each other as they move around the clock. At specific times like 3:00, 6:00, and 9:00, the hands create distinct angles.

- **3:00**: The hour hand points directly at the 3, and the minute hand points directly at the 12.
- **6:00**: The hour hand points directly at the 6, and the minute hand points directly at the 12.
- **9:00**: The hour hand points directly at the 9, and the minute hand points directly at the 12.

Each number on the clock represents 30 degrees (since \(360 \div 12 = 30\)).

---

### Step 2: Identify the Angles
At each of the specified times:
1. **3:00**:
   - The hour hand is at the 3, and the minute hand is at the 12.
   - The angle between the two hands is \(90^\circ\) because there are three numbers (each representing \(30^\circ\)) between the 3 and the 12.

2. **6:00**:
   - The hour hand is at the 6, and the minute hand is at the 12.
   - The angle between the two hands is \(180^\circ\) because there are six numbers (each representing \(30^\circ\)) between the 6 and the 12.

3. **9:00**:
   - The hour hand is at the 9, and the minute hand is at the 12.
   - The angle between the two hands is \(90^\circ\) because there are three numbers (each representing \(30^\circ\)) between the 9 and the 12.

---

### Step 3: Measure the Angles Using a Protractor
To measure these angles accurately with a protractor:
1. Draw a clock face on paper or use a physical clock model.
2. Mark the positions of the hour hand and minute hand for each time (3:00, 6:00, and 9:00).
3. Use a protractor to measure the angle between the two hands:
   - Place the center of the protractor at the center of the clock.
   - Align one arm of the protractor with the hour hand.
   - Read the angle where the minute hand intersects the protractor scale.

---

### Step 4: Record Your Measurements
After measuring the angles, record them:
- At **3:00**, the angle is \(90^\circ\).
- At **6:00**, the angle is \(180^\circ\).
- At **9:00**, the angle is \(90^\circ\).

---

### Final Answer:
The three angles measured are:
\[
\boxed{90^\circ, 180^\circ, 90^\circ}

"Sizes and measurement","Quantities in factual contexts","F","A blueprint of a house indicates a wall measuring 4 feet on the drawing with a scale of 1 inch : 3 feet; find the actual length of the wall in feet.","To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and apply the scale provided in the blueprint. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the scale
The scale of the blueprint is **1 inch : 3 feet**. This means that every inch on the drawing corresponds to 3 feet in real life.

---

### Step 2: Determine the length of the wall on the drawing
The problem states that the wall measures **4 feet** on the drawing. However, it’s important to note that the measurement on the drawing must be interpreted in terms of inches because the scale is based on inches.

Since there are **12 inches in a foot**, the length of the wall on the drawing in inches is:

"Sizes and measurement","Calculating quantities","G","A cyclist travels at a speed of 15 miles per hour; how long will it take to cover a distance of 45 miles?","To solve this problem, you can use the basic formula for calculating time when distance and speed are known. The formula is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Distance (\(d\)) = 45 miles
   - Speed (\(s\)) = 15 miles per hour

2. **Plug the values into the formula:**

"Sizes and measurement","Calculating quantities","G","A car and a truck start from the same point and travel in opposite directions; if the car travels at 60 miles per hour and the truck at 45 miles per hour how far apart will they be after 2 hours?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance between the car and the truck after 2 hours of travel. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- The car and the truck start at the same point.
- They travel in opposite directions.
- The car travels at **60 miles per hour**.
- The truck travels at **45 miles per hour**.
- We are tasked with finding how far apart they will be after **2 hours**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the Distance Each Vehicle Travels
The formula for distance is:
$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

#### For the car:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 2 hours
$$
\text{Distance traveled by the car} = 60 \times 2 = 120 \, \text{miles}
$$

#### For the truck:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 2 hours
$$
\text{Distance traveled by the truck} = 45 \times 2 = 90 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the Distances
Since the car and the truck are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
$$
\text{Total distance apart} = \text{Distance traveled by the car} + \text{Distance traveled by the truck}
$$
$$
\text{Total distance apart} = 120 + 90 = 210 \, \text{miles}

After 2 hours, the car and the truck will be **$\boxed{210 \, \text{miles}}$** apart."
"Sizes and measurement","Calculating quantities","G","A runner completes a 5-kilometer race in 25 minutes; what was their average speed in miles per hour?","To solve this problem, you need to calculate the runner's average speed in miles per hour (mph). Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to approach it:

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between distance, time, and speed
The formula for calculating speed is:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]
In this case, the distance is given in kilometers, and the time is given in minutes. However, the desired result is in miles per hour, so we'll need to convert units appropriately.

---

### Step 2: Convert the distance from kilometers to miles
Since the distance is given in kilometers, but the final answer must be in miles, we use the conversion factor:
\[
1 \text{ kilometer} = 0.621371 \text{ miles}
\]
Thus, the 5-kilometer race is equivalent to:
\[
5 \text{ km} \times 0.621371 \text{ miles/km} = 3.106855 \text{ miles}
\]

---

### Step 3: Convert the time from minutes to hours
The time is given as 25 minutes, but the speed needs to be expressed in terms of hours. To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[
25 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 0.416667 \text{ hours}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the average speed in miles per hour
Now that both the distance and time are in the correct units, substitute them into the speed formula:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{3.106855 \text{ miles}}{0.416667 \text{ hours}}
\]
Perform the division:
\[
\text{Speed} = 7.456 \text{ mph}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The runner's average speed was approximately **7.46 miles per hour**.

---

### Summary of Key Steps:
1. Convert the distance from kilometers to miles.
2. Convert the time from minutes to hours.
3. Use the speed formula (\(\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}\)) to calculate the result.

This method ensures that all units are consistent and the final answer is accurate."

### Step 1: Understand the Pictogram
A pictogram uses symbols or pictures to represent data. In this case, the pictogram is showing apples, bananas, and oranges. Each picture (or symbol) likely represents a certain number of items. Look for a key or legend that explains how many items each picture stands for. For example:
- One apple picture might represent 5 apples.
- One banana picture might represent 3 bananas.
- One orange picture might represent 4 oranges.

If there is no key provided, assume that each picture represents one item unless otherwise stated.

### Step 2: Count the Pictures
Count the number of apple, banana, and orange pictures in the pictogram. Let’s say:
- There are **6 apple pictures**.
- There are **4 banana pictures**.
- There are **3 orange pictures**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Actual Numbers
Using the key (if provided), calculate the actual number of apples, bananas, and oranges. If the key says:
- One apple picture = 5 apples,
- One banana picture = 3 bananas,
- One orange picture = 4 oranges,

Then:
- Total apples = 6 × 5 = **30 apples**,
- Total bananas = 4 × 3 = **12 bananas**,
- Total oranges = 3 × 4 = **12 oranges**.

If there is no key, simply use the number of pictures as the actual count:
- Apples = 6,
- Bananas = 4,
- Oranges = 3.

### Step 4: Compare Apples and Oranges
Now, find out how many more apples there are than oranges. Subtract the total number of oranges from the total number of apples:
- Difference = Number of apples - Number of oranges.

Using the example above:
- Difference = 30 (apples) - 12 (oranges) = **18 more apples**.

If no key is provided:
- Difference = 6 (apples) - 3 (oranges) = **3 more apples**.

### Final Answer:
The number of apples that are more than oranges is **boxed** below:

### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
To ensure accuracy, let’s verify the calculation:
- Total students = 100
- Percentage for bananas = 35%
- \( 35\% \) of 100 = \( \frac{35}{100} \times 100 = 35 \)

The calculation checks out.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]

So, **35 students** chose bananas as their favorite fruit."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","E","If in a pie chart representing a class's activity participation 15% of students chose sports what is the percentage of students who didn’t choose sports if there are 40 students in total?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the problem
The pie chart represents the class's activity participation. We are told that **15% of the students chose sports**. The task is to find the percentage of students who **did not choose sports**.

Additionally, we know there are **40 students in total**, but this number is not necessary for calculating percentages (since percentages are relative values).

---

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage of students who didn't choose sports
If 15% of the students chose sports, then the remaining percentage of students must have chosen other activities. Since the total percentage in a pie chart always adds up to **100%**, we can calculate the percentage of students who didn't choose sports as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage of students who didn't choose sports} = 100\% - 15\%
\]

\[
\text{Percentage of students who didn't choose sports} = 85\%
\]

---

### Step 3: Verify the result
The calculation confirms that if 15% of the students chose sports, the remaining 85% did not choose sports.

---

### Final Answer:
The percentage of students who didn’t choose sports is **\boxed{85\%}**."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","E","In a pie chart depicting the distribution of pets in a neighborhood dogs make up 40% and cats 30%; what proportion of pets do other animals represent if the total pets are 200?","To solve this task, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The pie chart represents the distribution of pets in a neighborhood.
- Dogs make up **40%** of the total pets.
- Cats make up **30%** of the total pets.
- The total number of pets in the neighborhood is **200**.

We are tasked with finding the proportion of pets that ""other animals"" represent.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage of ""other animals""
The percentages for all categories in a pie chart must add up to **100%**. Since dogs and cats together account for:
\[
40\% + 30\% = 70\%
\]
The remaining percentage for ""other animals"" is:
\[
100\% - 70\% = 30\%
\]

Thus, ""other animals"" make up **30%** of the total pets.

---

### Step 3: Convert the percentage into an actual number of pets
To find the number of ""other animals,"" calculate **30% of 200**:
\[
30\% \times 200 = \frac{30}{100} \times 200 = 60
\]

So, there are **60 other animals** in the neighborhood.

---

### Step 4: Express the proportion of ""other animals""
The proportion of ""other animals"" can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Proportion of other animals} = \frac{\text{Number of other animals}}{\text{Total number of pets}} = \frac{60}{200} = 0.3
\]

This means ""other animals"" represent **30%** or **0.3** of the total pets.

---

### Final Answer:
The proportion of pets that ""other animals"" represent is **0.3** (or **30%**)."

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","E","A class of 30 students were surveyed about their favorite color: Red (10) Blue (12) Green (5) and Yellow (3); create a frequency table to display these results.","To solve this task, you need to create a frequency table that displays the results of the survey. A frequency table is a way of organizing and summarizing data by showing how often each category occurs. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to do it:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Data
The survey results are as follows:
- **Red**: 10 students
- **Blue**: 12 students
- **Green**: 5 students
- **Yellow**: 3 students

This means there are four categories (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow), and each category has a corresponding frequency (the number of students who chose that color).

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Table Structure
A frequency table typically has two columns:
1. **Category**: The names of the categories (in this case, the colors).
2. **Frequency**: The count or number of occurrences for each category.

---

### Step 3: Fill in the Categories and Frequencies
Using the given data, fill in the categories and their respective frequencies into the table.

| **Color** | **Frequency** |
|-----------|---------------|
| Red       | 10            |
| Blue      | 12            |
| Green     | 5             |
| Yellow    | 3             |

---

### Step 4: Verify the Total
To ensure the data is correct, add up all the frequencies and confirm that the total matches the number of students surveyed. In this case:
$$
10 + 12 + 5 + 3 = 30
$$
Since the total is 30, which matches the number of students surveyed, the data is consistent.

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","E","In a survey 20 students were asked how many books they read last month resulting in the following counts: 0 books (5) 1 book (8) 2 books (4) and 3 books (3); present these data in a frequency table and explain what the table indicates about reading habits.","To solve this task, let's break it down into steps and create a frequency table. Then, we'll analyze what the table tells us about the students' reading habits.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Data
The data provided shows how many books each student read last month:
- **0 books**: 5 students
- **1 book**: 8 students
- **2 books**: 4 students
- **3 books**: 3 students

This means there are four categories of responses (0, 1, 2, and 3 books), and for each category, we know the number of students who fall into that category.

---

### Step 2: Create the Frequency Table
A frequency table organizes the data into two columns: one for the categories (number of books) and the other for the frequencies (number of students).

| Number of Books | Frequency (Number of Students) |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| 0               | 5                              |
| 1               | 8                              |
| 2               | 4                              |
| 3               | 3                              |

---

### Step 3: Verify the Total
To ensure the data is accurate, sum up the frequencies:
\[ 5 + 8 + 4 + 3 = 20 \]
Since the total matches the number of students surveyed (20), the data is consistent.

---

### Step 4: Interpret the Table
Now, let’s interpret what the table indicates about the students' reading habits:

1. **Most Common Response**: The highest frequency is for students who read **1 book** (8 students). This suggests that reading one book per month is the most common habit among the surveyed students.

2. **Least Common Response**: The lowest frequency is for students who read **3 books** (3 students). This indicates that very few students read three books in a month.

3. **Students Who Read Nothing**: A significant portion of the students (5 out of 20, or 25%) did not read any books last month. This might suggest that some students have low engagement with reading.

4. **Overall Reading Trend**: The majority of students (8 + 4 + 3 = 15 out of 20, or 75%) read at least one book last month. This shows that most students do engage in reading to some extent.

---

### Final Answer
The frequency table is as follows:

| Number of Books | Frequency (Number of Students) |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| 0               | 5                              |
| 1               | 8                              |
| 2               | 4                              |
| 3               | 3                              |

**What the table indicates about reading habits**:
- Most students (8 out of 20) read 1 book last month.
- A quarter of the students (5 out of 20) did not read any books.
- Only a small fraction (3 out of 20) read 3 books, indicating that extensive reading is less common among the surveyed group. 

Thus, the majority of students read at least one book, but there is also a notable group that does not read at all."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","G","Analyze the given stem-and-leaf plot representing the ages of students in a class to determine the mean age.","To solve the task of determining the mean age from a stem-and-leaf plot, let's break it down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Stem-and-Leaf Plot**
A stem-and-leaf plot is a way to represent data visually. It separates each number into two parts:
- **Stem**: The leading digit(s) of the number.
- **Leaf**: The trailing digit(s) of the number.

For example, in the number 23, ""2"" would be the stem and ""3"" would be the leaf. In a plot, all the stems are listed in ascending order on the left side, and the corresponding leaves are listed on the right side.

Example of a stem-and-leaf plot for ages:
```
Stem | Leaf
2    | 3 5 7
3    | 0 1 2 4 6
4    | 1 5
```
This represents the following data: 23, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 41, 45.

---

### **Step 2: Extract All the Data Points**
From the stem-and-leaf plot, write out all the individual data points (ages). For example, using the above plot:
- Stem ""2"" with leaves ""3, 5, 7"" gives: 23, 25, 27.
- Stem ""3"" with leaves ""0, 1, 2, 4, 6"" gives: 30, 31, 32, 34, 36.
- Stem ""4"" with leaves ""1, 5"" gives: 41, 45.

So, the full list of ages is: **23, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 41, 45**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the Sum of All Ages**
Add up all the ages from the list. Using the example:
\[
23 + 25 + 27 + 30 + 31 + 32 + 34 + 36 + 41 + 45 = 324
\]

---

### **Step 4: Count the Number of Students**
Count how many data points (ages) there are. In this case, there are 10 students.

---

### **Step 5: Compute the Mean**
The formula for the mean is:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all ages}}{\text{Number of students}}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{324}{10} = 32.4
\]

---

### **Final Answer**
The mean age of the students is **32.4 years**.

---

### **Key Tips**
1. Ensure you correctly interpret the stem-and-leaf plot to extract all data points.
2. Double-check your addition when calculating the sum of the ages.
3. Verify the count of data points to avoid errors in division.

Here's how you can approach it:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Stem-and-Leaf Plot**
A stem-and-leaf plot organizes data into ""stems"" (the leading digits) and ""leaves"" (the trailing digits). Each row in the plot represents a group of numbers.

For example:
```
Stem | Leaf
  6  | 2 5 8
  7  | 0 3 7
  8  | 1 4 9
```
This represents the scores: 62, 65, 68, 70, 73, 77, 81, 84, 89.

---

### **Step 2: List All the Scores**
Write out all the scores in numerical order based on the stem-and-leaf plot. This will help you visualize the full dataset.

For example, if the stem-and-leaf plot is:
```
Stem | Leaf

  6  | 2 4 7
  7  | 0 3 5 8
  8  | 1 4
```
The scores would be:
55, 58, 62, 64, 67, 70, 73, 75, 78, 81, 84.

---

### **Step 3: Count the Total Number of Scores**
Determine how many scores there are in total. Let’s call this number $ n $.

In the example above, there are 11 scores ($ n = 11 $).

---

### **Step 4: Determine the Position of the Median**
The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order. To find its position:
- If $ n $ is odd, the median is at position $ \frac{n+1}{2} $.
- If $ n $ is even, the median is the average of the two middle values, located at positions $ \frac{n}{2} $ and $ \frac{n}{2} + 1 $.

In our example ($ n = 11 $):
$$
\text{Median position} = \frac{11+1}{2} = 6
$$
So, the median is the 6th score in the ordered list.

---

### **Step 5: Identify the Median Score**
Locate the score at the calculated position in the ordered list.

From the example:
The scores are: 55, 58, 62, 64, 67, **70**, 73, 75, 78, 81, 84.
The 6th score is **70**.

Thus, the median score is **70**.

---

### **Summary**
1. Extract all the scores from the stem-and-leaf plot.
2. Arrange them in ascending order.
3. Count the total number of scores ($ n $).
4. Use the formula to find the position of the median.
5. Identify the median score in the list.

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Collecting presenting and reading data","G","Using the stem-and-leaf plot showing the number of books read by different students identify the mode of the dataset.","To solve the task of identifying the mode from a stem-and-leaf plot, let's break it down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand what a stem-and-leaf plot is**
A stem-and-leaf plot is a way to organize data where:
- The ""stem"" represents the leading digits (usually the tens or hundreds place).
- The ""leaf"" represents the trailing digits (usually the ones place).

For example, in the number **27**, the stem would be **2** and the leaf would be **7**.

The plot visually organizes data so you can easily see the distribution of values.

---

### **Step 2: Recall the definition of mode**
The **mode** is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. If there are multiple values with the same highest frequency, the dataset is multimodal. If no value repeats, there is no mode.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the stem-and-leaf plot**
Look at the stem-and-leaf plot provided. Each row corresponds to a range of numbers based on the stem. For example:
```
Stem | Leaf
2    | 3 5 5 7
3    | 0 1 1 1 4 6
4    | 2 8
```
Here:
- The stem ""2"" represents numbers starting with 2 (e.g., 23, 25, 25, 27).
- The stem ""3"" represents numbers starting with 3 (e.g., 30, 31, 31, 31, 34, 36).
- The stem ""4"" represents numbers starting with 4 (e.g., 42, 48).

---

### **Step 4: Count the frequency of each value**
Go through the plot and count how many times each number appears. In the example above:
- **23**: 1 time
- **25**: 2 times
- **27**: 1 time
- **30**: 1 time
- **31**: 3 times
- **34**: 1 time
- **36**: 1 time
- **42**: 1 time
- **48**: 1 time

---

### **Step 5: Identify the mode**
The mode is the number(s) with the highest frequency. From the counts above:
- The number **31** appears **3 times**, which is more frequent than any other number.

Thus, the mode of this dataset is **31**.

---

### **Step 6: Handle special cases**
- **Multimodal dataset**: If two or more numbers have the same highest frequency, the dataset is multimodal. For example, if both 25 and 31 appeared 3 times, the mode would be **25 and 31**.
- **No mode**: If all numbers appear only once, the dataset has no mode.

---

### **Final Answer**
To find the mode from a stem-and-leaf plot:
1. Count the frequency of each value.
2. Identify the value(s) with the highest frequency.
3. If there is a tie, the dataset is multimodal. If no value repeats, there is no mode.

In the example above, the **mode is 31**.

---

### Step 1: **Understand the Bar Chart**
- Carefully examine the bar chart. Look for labels on both axes:
  - The **x-axis** typically represents the categories (in this case, types of pets such as dogs, cats, birds, etc.).
  - The **y-axis** represents the number of owners or families that own each type of pet.
- Make sure you understand the scale of the y-axis (e.g., is it counting in increments of 1, 5, 10, etc.?).

---

### Step 2: **Identify the Heights of the Bars**
- Each bar corresponds to a specific type of pet. The height of the bar indicates how many owners or families have that pet.
- Compare the heights of the bars visually. The tallest bar represents the pet with the most owners.

---

### Step 3: **Read the Exact Values**
- If exact numbers are provided on the chart (either directly on the bars or at intervals on the y-axis), read the value corresponding to the top of the tallest bar. This will confirm the number of owners for the most popular pet.

---

### Step 4: **Determine the Pet Type**
- Identify which pet corresponds to the tallest bar by looking at the label on the x-axis below that bar.
- For example, if the tallest bar aligns with ""dogs"" on the x-axis, then dogs are the pet with the most owners.

---

### Step 5: **Double-Check Your Answer**
- Re-examine the chart to ensure no other bar is taller than the one you identified.
- Verify that you correctly matched the tallest bar to its corresponding pet type.

---

### Example Walkthrough
Let’s say the bar chart shows the following data:
- Dogs: 40 owners
- Cats: 35 owners
- Birds: 25 owners
- Fish: 20 owners

The tallest bar corresponds to ""Dogs,"" with 40 owners. Therefore, the pet with the most owners is **dogs**.

---

### Final Answer Format
Once you’ve determined the pet with the most owners, clearly state your conclusion. For example:
**""The pet with the most owners is [pet type].""**

If you’re solving this for an assignment or test, make sure to include any additional details requested, such as the exact number of owners.

### Step 1: Understand the Bar Chart
- **Identify the x-axis and y-axis**: The x-axis typically represents the categories (in this case, the different snacks), while the y-axis represents the values (in this case, the number of students who chose each snack).
- **Check the scale**: Look at the scale on the y-axis to understand the increments (e.g., does it increase by 1, 5, 10, etc.?).

### Step 2: Examine the Bars
- Each bar corresponds to a specific snack. The height of the bar indicates how many students chose that particular snack.
- Compare the heights of the bars visually or by reading the exact values from the y-axis.

### Step 3: Identify the Tallest Bar
- The tallest bar corresponds to the snack chosen by the highest number of students.
- If the chart includes numerical values for each bar, you can directly compare these numbers.

### Step 4: Confirm Your Answer
- Double-check your observation by ensuring that no other bar surpasses the height of the one you identified.
- If there are ties (two or more bars of the same height), note that multiple snacks were equally popular.

### Example:
Suppose the bar chart shows the following data:
- Chips: 25 students
- Cookies: 30 students
- Fruit: 20 students
- Candy: 35 students

Here, the tallest bar would correspond to ""Candy"" because it was chosen by 35 students, which is the highest number.

### Final Answer:
The snack chosen by the highest number of students is **the one represented by the tallest bar**. If you're working with actual data, replace ""tallest bar"" with the specific snack name based on your observations.

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Evaluate the given histogram showing the number of books read by students in a month and determine which student category has the highest frequency.","To solve the task of evaluating a histogram to determine which student category has the highest frequency of books read in a month, follow these detailed steps:

### 1. **Understand the Histogram**
   - **Definition**: A histogram is a graphical representation of data using bars of different heights. In your case, it shows the number of books read by students categorized into groups.
   - **Axes**:
     - The **x-axis** typically represents the categories or intervals (e.g., number of books read: 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, etc.).
     - The **y-axis** represents the frequency, i.e., the number of students falling into each category.

### 2. **Examine the Histogram Carefully**
   - Look at the bars on the histogram. Each bar corresponds to a specific category on the x-axis.
   - Observe the height of each bar, as this indicates the frequency (number of students) for that category.

### 3. **Identify the Highest Bar**
   - Compare the heights of all the bars in the histogram.
   - The tallest bar represents the category with the highest frequency. This means more students fall into this category compared to others.

### 4. **Determine the Corresponding Category**
   - Once you’ve identified the tallest bar, check the x-axis to see which category it corresponds to.
   - For example, if the tallest bar aligns with the ""3-5 books"" category on the x-axis, then the category ""3-5 books"" has the highest frequency.

### 5. **Verify Your Observation**
   - Double-check by comparing the height of the tallest bar with other bars to ensure accuracy.
   - If numerical values are provided on the y-axis, confirm the exact frequency associated with the tallest bar.

### 6. **State Your Conclusion**
   - Clearly state which student category has the highest frequency based on your analysis.
   - Example conclusion: ""The category '3-5 books' has the highest frequency, indicating that most students read between 3 to 5 books in a month.""

### Example Walkthrough:
Suppose the histogram has the following categories on the x-axis: 
- ""0-2 books""
- ""3-5 books""
- ""6-8 books""
- ""9+ books""

And the corresponding frequencies (heights of bars) are:
- ""0-2 books"": 10 students
- ""3-5 books"": 25 students
- ""6-8 books"": 15 students
- ""9+ books"": 5 students

Here, the tallest bar would be for the ""3-5 books"" category with 25 students. Thus, the category with the highest frequency is ""3-5 books.""

### Final Answer:
After analyzing the histogram, the **student category with the highest frequency** is the one represented by the tallest bar. Ensure you clearly identify and state this category based on the x-axis labels.

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Analyze the histogram that represents daily temperatures over a month and discuss whether the data appears to show a consistent pattern or significant fluctuations.","To analyze the histogram representing daily temperatures over a month and determine whether the data shows a consistent pattern or significant fluctuations, follow these structured steps:

---

### **1. Understand the Histogram**
A histogram is a graphical representation of data distribution, where the x-axis represents temperature ranges (bins) and the y-axis represents the frequency (number of days) within each range. Before analyzing, ensure you understand:
- The temperature intervals (bins) used on the x-axis.
- The scale of the y-axis (frequency).
- Any labels, titles, or additional information provided with the histogram.

---

### **2. Assess the Shape of the Distribution**
The shape of the histogram provides insights into the pattern of the data:
- **Symmetrical Bell Curve:** If the histogram forms a bell-shaped curve, it indicates that temperatures are clustered around a central value, suggesting consistency with some natural variation.
- **Skewed Distribution:** A skewed histogram (leaning to the left or right) suggests that temperatures are more frequent at one end of the range, possibly indicating a trend toward warmer or cooler weather.
- **Uniform Distribution:** If the bars are roughly equal in height, it implies no clear central tendency, meaning temperatures vary widely without a dominant range.
- **Bimodal or Multimodal Distribution:** Multiple peaks suggest two or more distinct temperature patterns during the month.

---

### **3. Identify Key Statistics**
Extract meaningful statistics from the histogram:
- **Mode:** The temperature range with the highest frequency (tallest bar). This represents the most common temperature during the month.
- **Range:** The difference between the highest and lowest temperature bins. A wide range indicates significant fluctuations.
- **Spread:** Look at how the data is distributed across the bins. Narrow spread suggests consistency, while wide spread indicates variability.

---

### **4. Evaluate Consistency vs. Fluctuations**
Based on the above analysis:
- **Consistent Pattern:** If the histogram shows a narrow range, symmetrical distribution, or a single dominant peak, the data likely reflects a consistent temperature pattern.
- **Significant Fluctuations:** If the histogram has a wide range, uneven distribution, or multiple peaks, it suggests substantial variations in temperature throughout the month.

---

### **5. Consider External Factors**
Temperature patterns can be influenced by external factors such as seasonality, weather events, or geographical location. Ask yourself:
- Is the month part of a transitional season (e.g., spring or fall), which might naturally cause fluctuations?
- Were there any unusual weather events (e.g., heatwaves or cold snaps) that could explain outliers in the data?

---

### **6. Draw Conclusions**
Summarize your findings:
- State whether the data shows a consistent pattern or significant fluctuations.
- Justify your conclusion using evidence from the histogram's shape, key statistics, and any contextual factors.

---

### Example Analysis
Suppose the histogram shows:
- A bell-shaped curve centered around 70°F with a narrow range (60°F–80°F).
- A mode at 70°F and a small standard deviation.

**Conclusion:** The data indicates a consistent temperature pattern, with most days falling within a narrow range around 70°F. There are no significant fluctuations, suggesting stable weather conditions for the month.

Alternatively, if the histogram has:
- Uneven bars spanning a wide range (40°F–90°F).
- Multiple peaks at 50°F and 80°F.

**Conclusion:** The data reflects significant fluctuations in temperature, with distinct patterns of cooler and warmer days. This could indicate a transitional season or the influence of varying weather systems.

---

By following these steps, you can systematically analyze the histogram and draw well-supported conclusions about the temperature data."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Using the histogram of pets owned by families in your neighborhood compare the frequency of dogs to the frequency of cats and interpret what this might say about pet ownership trends.","To solve this task, you'll need to follow a structured approach that involves analyzing the histogram data and interpreting the results. Here's how you can proceed step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Histogram**
A histogram is a graphical representation of data using bars of different heights. In this case:
- The x-axis likely represents the types of pets (e.g., dogs, cats, other animals).
- The y-axis represents the frequency or count of families owning each type of pet.

Take note of:
- The height of the bar for ""dogs.""
- The height of the bar for ""cats.""

These heights directly correspond to the number of families owning dogs and cats, respectively.

---

### **Step 2: Compare the Frequencies**
Once you identify the frequencies from the histogram:
1. **Extract the Data**: Determine the exact number of families owning dogs and cats.
   - For example, if the bar for dogs reaches up to 40 on the y-axis, then 40 families own dogs.
   - If the bar for cats reaches up to 30, then 30 families own cats.
2. **Calculate Ratios or Differences**:
   - Find the difference: \( \text{Difference} = \text{Frequency of Dogs} - \text{Frequency of Cats} \).
   - Calculate the ratio: \( \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Frequency of Dogs}}{\text{Frequency of Cats}} \).

For instance:
- If 40 families own dogs and 30 own cats:
  - Difference: \( 40 - 30 = 10 \) more families own dogs than cats.
  - Ratio: \( \frac{40}{30} = 1.33 \), meaning there are 1.33 times as many dog-owning families as cat-owning families.

---

### **Step 3: Interpret the Results**
Based on your comparison, interpret what the data might say about pet ownership trends in your neighborhood. Consider factors such as:
1. **Popularity of Pets**:
   - If more families own dogs than cats, it suggests that dogs are more popular in your neighborhood.
   - Conversely, if more families own cats, it implies a preference for cats.

2. **Possible Reasons**:
   - Dogs may be preferred due to their companionship, outdoor activities, or security benefits.
   - Cats may be favored for their low-maintenance nature, indoor adaptability, or smaller living space requirements.

3. **Demographics**:
   - The trend might reflect the age, lifestyle, or housing situation of families in the neighborhood. For example:
     - Families with larger homes or yards may prefer dogs.
     - Apartments or urban areas might see higher cat ownership due to space constraints.

4. **Cultural or Regional Preferences**:
   - Some regions or communities have cultural preferences for certain pets.

---

### **Step 4: Communicate Your Findings**
Summarize your analysis clearly:
- State the frequencies of dog and cat ownership.
- Highlight the difference or ratio between the two.
- Provide an interpretation of what this might indicate about pet ownership trends.

For example:
> ""In our neighborhood, 40 families own dogs, while 30 families own cats. This indicates that dog ownership is more common, with 10 more families owning dogs than cats. The ratio of dog-owning families to cat-owning families is approximately 1.33:1. This trend may suggest a preference for dogs due to their active and social nature, though further investigation into family demographics and living conditions could provide additional insights.""

---

By following these steps, you can effectively compare the frequency of dogs to cats and draw meaningful conclusions about pet ownership trends in your neighborhood."

### Step 1: Analyze the Bar Graph
- Carefully examine the bar graph displaying monthly rainfall data. Each bar represents the total rainfall for a specific month.
- Look for the shortest bar, which indicates the month with the least rainfall, and the tallest bar, which indicates the month with the highest rainfall.

### Step 2: Identify the Months
- Once you have identified the shortest and tallest bars, note the corresponding months on the x-axis of the graph.
  - The month associated with the shortest bar is the month with the least rainfall.
  - The month associated with the tallest bar is the month with the highest rainfall.

### Step 3: Determine Rainfall Values
- Read the values (in inches) from the y-axis for both the shortest and tallest bars.
  - Let the rainfall value for the month with the least rainfall be \( R_{\text{least}} \).
  - Let the rainfall value for the month with the highest rainfall be \( R_{\text{highest}} \).

### Step 4: Calculate the Difference
- Subtract the rainfall value of the month with the least rainfall from the rainfall value of the month with the highest rainfall:
  \[
  \text{Difference} = R_{\text{highest}} - R_{\text{least}}
  \]
- This will give you the difference in inches between the two months.

### Step 5: Explain the Results
- Clearly state the month with the least rainfall and its value.
- Clearly state the month with the highest rainfall and its value.
- Provide the calculated difference in inches and explain how much greater the rainfall is in the month with the highest rainfall compared to the month with the least rainfall.

---

### Example Explanation
Suppose the bar graph shows the following data:
- The shortest bar corresponds to February with \( R_{\text{least}} = 0.5 \) inches.
- The tallest bar corresponds to June with \( R_{\text{highest}} = 4.0 \) inches.

**Calculation:**
\[
\text{Difference} = R_{\text{highest}} - R_{\text{least}} = 4.0 - 0.5 = 3.5 \, \text{inches}.
\]

**Explanation:**
The month with the least rainfall is February, with only 0.5 inches of rain. The month with the highest rainfall is June, with 4.0 inches of rain. The difference in rainfall between these two months is 3.5 inches, meaning June receives significantly more rainfall than February.

- The majority of the data is concentrated on the left side.
- There is a long tail extending to the right.
- The mean is greater than the median.

**Conclusion**: The data is **positively skewed** because the tail is longer on the right, and the mean is pulled in the direction of the tail.

---

By following these steps, you can systematically analyze any histogram and determine its skewness or symmetry."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Calculate the mean and median of the data represented in the histogram and discuss which measure of central tendency better represents the dataset.","To solve the task of calculating the mean and median of data represented in a histogram, and discussing which measure of central tendency better represents the dataset, follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Histogram**
A histogram displays the frequency distribution of continuous data. Each bar represents a range (or bin) of values, and the height of the bar indicates how many data points fall within that range.

- Identify the bins (ranges) and their frequencies from the histogram.
- If the histogram does not explicitly provide the exact values within each bin, assume the midpoint of each bin as the representative value for all data points in that bin.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the Mean**
The mean is the average value of the dataset. To calculate it:
1. Multiply the midpoint of each bin by its frequency to get the total contribution of that bin to the mean.
2. Sum up these contributions across all bins.
3. Divide the total sum by the total number of data points (the sum of all frequencies).

**Formula:**
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum (\text{Midpoint of Bin} \times \text{Frequency})}{\sum \text{Frequency}}
\]

#### Example Calculation:
Suppose the histogram has the following bins and frequencies:
| Bin Range | Midpoint | Frequency |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 0–10      | 5        | 4         |
| 10–20     | 15       | 6         |
| 20–30     | 25       | 8         |
| 30–40     | 35       | 2         |

1. Compute the total contribution for each bin:
   - \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
   - \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \)
   - \( 25 \times 8 = 200 \)
   - \( 35 \times 2 = 70 \)

2. Sum up the contributions: \( 20 + 90 + 200 + 70 = 380 \)

3. Total frequency: \( 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20 \)

4. Mean: 
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{380}{20} = 19
   \]

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the Median**
The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order. To find the median from a histogram:
1. Determine the total number of data points (\( N \)) by summing all frequencies.
2. Find the position of the median in the ordered dataset:
   \[
   \text{Median Position} = \frac{N}{2} \quad \text{(for odd \( N \)), or between positions } \frac{N}{2} \text{ and } \frac{N}{2} + 1 \text{ (for even \( N \))}
   \]
3. Locate the bin that contains the median position.
4. Use interpolation to estimate the exact median value within that bin.

#### Example Calculation:
Using the same histogram as above:
1. Total frequency (\( N \)): \( 20 \)
2. Median position: \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) (10th data point)
3. Cumulative frequencies:
   - Bin 0–10: 4 (cumulative frequency = 4)
   - Bin 10–20: 6 (cumulative frequency = 10)
   - The 10th data point falls in the 10–20 bin.

4. Interpolation formula for the median:
   \[
   \text{Median} = L + \left( \frac{\frac{N}{2} - F}{f} \right) \times w
   \]
   Where:
   - \( L \): Lower boundary of the median bin (10)
   - \( N \): Total frequency (20)
   - \( F \): Cumulative frequency before the median bin (4)
   - \( f \): Frequency of the median bin (6)
   - \( w \): Width of the median bin (10)

   Substituting values:
   \[
   \text{Median} = 10 + \left( \frac{10 - 4}{6} \right) \times 10 = 10 + \frac{60}{6} = 10 + 10 = 20
   \]

---

### **Step 4: Compare Mean and Median**
After calculating both measures, compare them to determine which better represents the dataset:
1. **Symmetric Distribution**: If the histogram is symmetric, the mean and median will be approximately equal, and either can represent the dataset.
2. **Skewed Distribution**: 
   - In a positively skewed distribution (long tail to the right), the mean will be greater than the median because the outliers pull the mean higher.
   - In a negatively skewed distribution (long tail to the left), the mean will be less than the median.
   - In such cases, the median is often a better measure of central tendency because it is less affected by extreme values.

---

### **Step 5: Discuss the Results**
Based on the calculations and the shape of the histogram, discuss which measure (mean or median) provides a more accurate representation of the dataset. For example:
- If the histogram is symmetric, state that both measures are equally valid.
- If the histogram is skewed, explain why the median might be preferred over the mean.

---

By following these steps, you can calculate the mean and median of the dataset represented in the histogram and provide a thoughtful discussion about which measure of central tendency is most appropriate."
"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Comparing and evaluating data","F","Using the histogram provided identify the mode of the data and evaluate what this indicates about the most frequent occurrence in the dataset.","To solve the task of identifying the mode from a histogram and evaluating what it indicates about the dataset, follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Histogram**
A histogram is a graphical representation of data where the data is grouped into intervals (or bins) and represented by bars. The height of each bar corresponds to the frequency (number of occurrences) of data points within that interval.

- **Key components**:
  - **X-axis**: Represents the range of values or categories in the dataset.
  - **Y-axis**: Represents the frequency (how often each value or range of values occurs).

---

### **Step 2: Identify the Mode**
The mode is the value or range of values that occurs most frequently in the dataset. In a histogram, this corresponds to the bar with the highest height.

- **How to find the mode**:
  1. Look for the tallest bar in the histogram.
  2. Determine the range of values on the X-axis that corresponds to this bar.
  3. If the histogram uses discrete values instead of ranges, identify the specific value associated with the tallest bar.

---

### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mode**
Once you have identified the mode, interpret its significance in the context of the dataset:

- **What does the mode indicate?**
  - The mode tells you which value or range of values is most common in the dataset.
  - For example, if the mode is in the range 10–20, it means that more data points fall within this range than any other range.

- **Contextual analysis**:
  - Consider the type of data being analyzed. For instance:
    - If the data represents test scores, the mode might indicate the score range where most students performed.
    - If the data represents ages, the mode might indicate the age group with the largest population.

---

### **Step 4: Provide a Conclusion**
Summarize your findings by stating the mode and explaining its implications for the dataset.

- Example conclusion:
  - ""The mode of the dataset is the range 15–20, as this interval has the highest frequency. This indicates that most data points fall within this range, suggesting a concentration of values around this area.""

---

### **Additional Notes**
- If the histogram shows multiple bars with the same maximum height, the dataset is multimodal (i.e., it has multiple modes).
- If the histogram is skewed or has outliers, consider how these factors might influence the interpretation of the mode.

By following these steps, you can effectively identify the mode from a histogram and evaluate its meaning in the context of the dataset."

"Data; frequencies and probabilities","Understanding probabilities","H","A basketball player has a 70% free throw success rate and a 60% three-point success rate; what is the probability that he makes both a free throw and a three-pointer in the same game?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the basketball player makes both a free throw and a three-pointer in the same game. Let's break this down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the given probabilities
- The probability of making a **free throw** is \( P(\text{Free Throw}) = 0.7 \).
- The probability of making a **three-pointer** is \( P(\text{Three-Pointer}) = 0.6 \).

These probabilities are independent of each other unless otherwise stated. This means the outcome of one shot does not affect the outcome of the other.

---

### Step 2: Define the event of interest
We are interested in the event where the player makes **both** a free throw and a three-pointer. Since the two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities:

\[
P(\text{Both Free Throw and Three-Pointer}) = P(\text{Free Throw}) \times P(\text{Three-Pointer})
\]

---

### Step 3: Perform the calculation

### Step 1: Understand the problem
The factory produces two types of items:
- **Light bulbs**, with a 90% quality rate. This means the probability that a randomly chosen light bulb is of good quality is \( P(\text{Good Light Bulb}) = 0.9 \).
- **Batteries**, with an 85% quality rate. This means the probability that a randomly chosen battery is of good quality is \( P(\text{Good Battery}) = 0.85 \).

We are tasked with finding the probability that both a randomly chosen light bulb and a randomly chosen battery are of good quality.

### Step 2: Independence assumption
The problem does not explicitly state whether the quality of the light bulb and the battery are dependent or independent. However, unless otherwise stated, we assume that the quality of the light bulb and the battery are **independent** events. This means the quality of one item does not affect the quality of the other.

If the events are independent, the joint probability of both being of good quality can be calculated as the product of their individual probabilities:
\[
P(\text{Good Light Bulb and Good Battery}) = P(\text{Good Light Bulb}) \cdot P(\text{Good Battery})

Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Events
1. **Flipping a coin**: A coin has two sides, heads (H) and tails (T). The probability of flipping heads is:
   $$
   P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{1}{2}
   $$

2. **Rolling a die**: A standard six-sided die has numbers 1 through 6. The probability of rolling a specific number, such as 4, is:
   $$
   P(\text{Rolling a 4}) = \frac{1}{6}

---

### Step 2: Check for Independence
The two events—flipping a coin and rolling a die—are independent. This means the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the other. For independent events, the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Combined Probability
To find the probability of flipping heads **and** rolling a four, we multiply the probabilities of the two events:
$$

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We are drawing **two cards** consecutively from a standard 52-card deck. The goal is to find the probability that **both cards are hearts**. 

Key points:
- A standard deck has 52 cards.
- There are 13 hearts in the deck.
- The draws are done **without replacement**, meaning once a card is drawn, it is not put back into the deck.

---

### Step 2: Probability of Drawing the First Heart
The probability of drawing a heart on the first draw is the number of hearts divided by the total number of cards in the deck:

$$
P(\text{First Heart}) = \frac{\text{Number of Hearts}}{\text{Total Number of Cards}} = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4}.
$$

---

### Step 3: Probability of Drawing the Second Heart
After drawing the first heart, there are now **12 hearts left** in the deck, and the total number of remaining cards is **51** (since one card has already been drawn). The probability of drawing a second heart is:

$$
P(\text{Second Heart | First Heart}) = \frac{\text{Remaining Hearts}}{\text{Remaining Cards}} = \frac{12}{51}.
$$

---

### Step 4: Combine the Probabilities
Since the two events (drawing the first heart and drawing the second heart) are dependent, we multiply their probabilities together to get the overall probability:

$$
P(\text{Both Hearts}) = P(\text{First Heart}) \times P(\text{Second Heart | First Heart}).
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
P(\text{Both Hearts}) = \frac{13}{52} \times \frac{12}{51}.

Here's how you can approach it:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- A standard deck has 52 cards, including 4 Aces and 4 Kings.
- The task is to calculate the probability of drawing **an Ace first** and then **a King second**, without replacement (i.e., once a card is drawn, it is not returned to the deck).

---

### Step 2: Break Down the Events
The event consists of two sequential draws:
1. Drawing an Ace on the first draw.
2. Drawing a King on the second draw, given that an Ace was already drawn.

Since these events are dependent (the outcome of the first draw affects the second), we use the concept of conditional probability.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of Each Event
#### Event 1: Drawing an Ace First
There are 4 Aces in the deck and 52 total cards. The probability of drawing an Ace on the first draw is:
\[
P(\text{Ace on first draw}) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}.
\]

#### Event 2: Drawing a King Second (Given an Ace Was Drawn First)
After drawing an Ace, there are now 51 cards left in the deck, and all 4 Kings are still available. The probability of drawing a King on the second draw is:
\[
P(\text{King on second draw | Ace on first draw}) = \frac{4}{51}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Combine the Probabilities
Since the two events are dependent, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of each event:
\[
P(\text{Ace followed by King}) = P(\text{Ace on first draw}) \times P(\text{King on second draw | Ace on first draw}).
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P(\text{Ace followed by King}) = \frac{1}{13} \times \frac{4}{51} = \frac{4}{663}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Final Answer
The likelihood of drawing an Ace followed by a King in succession is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{4}{663}}
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Drawing the First Card (Queen of Spades)
The deck initially contains 52 cards, and there is exactly **1 Queen of Spades** in the deck. Therefore, the probability of drawing the Queen of Spades on the first draw is:

\[
P(\text{Queen of Spades}) = \frac{1}{52}
\]

---

### Step 3: Probability of Drawing the Second Card (Jack of Hearts)
After the Queen of Spades is drawn, the deck now contains **51 cards**. There is exactly **1 Jack of Hearts** remaining in the deck. Therefore, the probability of drawing the Jack of Hearts on the second draw is:

\[
P(\text{Jack of Hearts | Queen of Spades}) = \frac{1}{51}
\]

---

### Step 4: Combine the Probabilities
Since the two events (drawing the Queen of Spades and then the Jack of Hearts) are sequential and dependent (because the first card is not replaced), we multiply their probabilities:

\[
P(\text{Queen of Spades and Jack of Hearts}) = P(\text{Queen of Spades}) \times P(\text{Jack of Hearts | Queen of Spades})
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(\text{Queen of Spades and Jack of Hearts}) = \frac{1}{52} \times \frac{1}{51} = \frac{1}{2652}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The probability of drawing the Queen of Spades followed by the Jack of Hearts from a full deck without replacement is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2652}}
\] 

This result can also be expressed as approximately \(0.000377\) or \(0.0377\%\)."

A permutation is an arrangement of items in a specific order.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the number of books:**
   You have three distinct books:
   - A mystery novel
   - A science fiction book
   - A biography

2. **Determine the total number of arrangements:**
   For arranging \( n \) distinct items, the total number of permutations is given by \( n! \) (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \( n \).

   In this case, \( n = 3 \), so:
   \[
   3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
   \]

   Therefore, there are 6 possible arrangements of the three books.

3. **List all possible arrangements (optional):**
   To better understand the result, let’s explicitly list all the possible arrangements of the three books. Let's denote the books as follows:
   - \( M \): Mystery novel
   - \( S \): Science fiction book
   - \( B \): Biography

   The possible arrangements are:
   - \( M, S, B \)
   - \( M, B, S \)
   - \( S, M, B \)
   - \( S, B, M \)
   - \( B, M, S \)
   - \( B, S, M \)

### Known Information:
You have **three different desserts**: cake, pie, and ice cream. The task is to determine how many **unique orders** you can serve them in at a party.

This is a classic permutation problem because the order in which the desserts are served matters.

---

### Step 1: Understand Permutations
A **permutation** is an arrangement of items where the order matters. For example, serving ""cake first, pie second, and ice cream third"" is different from ""pie first, cake second, and ice cream third.""

The formula for the number of permutations of \( n \) distinct items is:

---

### Step 2: Apply the Formula
Here, \( n = 3 \) because there are three desserts (cake, pie, and ice cream). So, we calculate \( 3! \):

\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]

Thus, there are **6 unique orders** in which the desserts can be served.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
You are flipping **two coins** at the same time. Each coin has two possible outcomes:
- Heads (H)
- Tails (T)

The goal is to list all the possible outcomes of flipping these two coins and count how many outcomes there are.

---

### Step 2: Determine the possible outcomes for one coin
For a single coin, the outcomes are:
- H (Heads)
- T (Tails)

So, there are **2 outcomes** for one coin.

---

### Step 3: Combine the outcomes for two coins
When you flip two coins, each coin can independently result in either H or T. To find all the possible outcomes, we combine the results of the first coin with the results of the second coin.

Let’s denote the outcome of the first coin as $ C_1 $ and the outcome of the second coin as $ C_2 $. The possible combinations are:
1. $ C_1 = H $ and $ C_2 = H $ → HH
2. $ C_1 = H $ and $ C_2 = T $ → HT
3. $ C_1 = T $ and $ C_2 = H $ → TH
4. $ C_1 = T $ and $ C_2 = T $ → TT

Thus, the **complete list of possible outcomes** is:
$$ \{HH, HT, TH, TT\} $$

---

### Step 4: Count the number of outcomes
From the list above, we see that there are **4 possible outcomes** when flipping two coins.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
You are tossing two coins, and each coin can land in one of two possible outcomes: **Heads (H)** or **Tails (T)**. The goal is to:
1. List all possible combinations of outcomes for the two coins.
2. Determine the total number of these combinations.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Outcomes
Each coin toss has two possible outcomes:
- Coin 1: Heads (H) or Tails (T)
- Coin 2: Heads (H) or Tails (T)

When tossing two coins, the outcome of each coin is independent of the other. This means we need to consider all possible pairs of outcomes from the two coins.

---

### Step 3: Generate All Combinations
We can systematically list all possible combinations by pairing each outcome of Coin 1 with each outcome of Coin 2:

1. If Coin 1 is **H**:
   - Coin 2 can be **H**, resulting in **HH**
   - Coin 2 can be **T**, resulting in **HT**

2. If Coin 1 is **T**:
   - Coin 2 can be **H**, resulting in **TH**
   - Coin 2 can be **T**, resulting in **TT**

Thus, the complete list of combinations is:
- **HH**
- **HT**
- **TH**
- **TT**

- **Heads (H)** 
- **Tails (T)**

The goal is to determine all the different results that could appear when flipping two coins and calculate the total number of possible outcomes.

---

### Step 2: List all possible outcomes for two coin flips
When flipping two coins, each coin can independently result in either Heads or Tails. To find all the possible outcomes, we consider every combination of results from the two coins.

Let’s denote the first coin as Coin 1 and the second coin as Coin 2. The possible outcomes are:
1. Coin 1 = Heads, Coin 2 = Heads → **HH**
2. Coin 1 = Heads, Coin 2 = Tails → **HT**
3. Coin 1 = Tails, Coin 2 = Heads → **TH**
4. Coin 1 = Tails, Coin 2 = Tails → **TT**

Thus, the complete set of outcomes is:
$$ \{HH, HT, TH, TT\} $$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of outcomes
Each coin flip has 2 possible outcomes (Heads or Tails). Since the two coin flips are independent, the total number of outcomes is given by multiplying the number of outcomes for each coin:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - You have 5 different fruits in the basket.
   - You want to select 2 fruits to make a fruit salad.
   - The order in which you select the fruits does not matter (e.g., selecting an apple and a banana is the same as selecting a banana and an apple).

2. **Use Combinatorics Formula**:
   - The number of ways to choose \( r \) items from \( n \) distinct items is given by the combination formula:
     \[
     C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
     \]
     where \( n! \) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \), and \( r! \) and \( (n-r)! \) are similarly defined.

3. **Substitute Values**:
   - Here, \( n = 5 \) (the total number of fruits) and \( r = 2 \) (the number of fruits to choose).
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 3!}

This is a classic combinatorics problem where order does not matter.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a class of 5 students, and we need to select 2 representatives. The key here is that the order in which we choose the students does not matter. For example, choosing Student A and Student B is the same as choosing Student B and Student A.

### Step 2: Use the Combination Formula
The formula for calculating combinations is:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

Where:
- \( n \) is the total number of items (students in this case),
- \( r \) is the number of items to choose,
- \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem:
- \( n = 5 \) (total number of students),
- \( r = 2 \) (number of representatives to choose).

### Step 3: Plug Values into the Formula
Substitute \( n = 5 \) and \( r = 2 \) into the formula:

\[
C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 3!}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the Factorials
Recall that \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \), but we don't need to fully expand it because \( 3! \) will cancel out part of \( 5! \):

\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3!
\]

So:

\[
C(5, 2) = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{2! \times 3!}
\]

Cancel \( 3! \) from the numerator and denominator:

\[
C(5, 2) = \frac{5 \times 4}{2!}
\]

Now calculate \( 2! \):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

So:

\[
C(5, 2) = \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10

This is a **combinatorics** problem, specifically one involving combinations (not permutations), because the order in which the marbles are chosen does not matter.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - There are 5 marbles.
   - A player picks 2 marbles.
   - The order of selection does not matter (e.g., selecting marble A first and then marble B is the same as selecting marble B first and then marble A).

2. **Use the Combination Formula:**
   The formula for combinations is given by:
   \[
   C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
   \]
   where:
   - \( n \) is the total number of items (in this case, 5 marbles),
   - \( r \) is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2 marbles),
   - \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 5 \) and \( r = 2 \). Substituting these into the formula:
   \[
   C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 3!}
   \]

4. **Simplify the Factorials:**
   Recall that \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \), but since \( 3! \) appears in the denominator, we can cancel out \( 3 \times 2 \times 1 \):
   \[
   C(5, 2) = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{2! \times 3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2!}

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem
The bacteria culture **doubles in size every hour**, meaning that at the end of each hour, the population is twice what it was at the start of that hour. The initial population is **500 bacteria**, and we are tasked with finding the population after **4 hours**.

---

### Step 2: Identify the formula for exponential growth
For a population that doubles every hour, the formula is:

\[
P(t) = P_0 \cdot 2^t
\]

Where:
- \(P(t)\) is the population at time \(t\) (in hours),
- \(P_0\) is the initial population,
- \(t\) is the time elapsed (in hours).

In this case:
- \(P_0 = 500\) (initial population),
- \(t = 4\) (we want the population after 4 hours).

---

### Step 3: Plug the values into the formula
Substitute \(P_0 = 500\) and \(t = 4\) into the formula:

\[
P(4) = 500 \cdot 2^4
\]

---

### Step 4: Simplify the expression
First, calculate \(2^4\):

\[
2^4 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 16
\]

Now multiply by the initial population:

\[
P(4) = 500 \cdot 16 = 8000
\]

---

### Step 5: State the final answer
After 4 hours, the population of the bacteria will be:

\[
\boxed{8000}
\]

---

### Verification through step-by-step growth
If you prefer to verify this by calculating the population incrementally for each hour:
1. Start with 500 bacteria.
2. After 1 hour: \(500 \cdot 2 = 1000\).
3. After 2 hours: \(1000 \cdot 2 = 2000\).
4. After 3 hours: \(2000 \cdot 2 = 4000\).

Let’s break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the depreciation process**
Depreciation means the car loses a percentage of its value every year. In this case, the car loses **15%** of its value annually. This means that at the end of each year, the car retains **85%** of its value from the previous year (since \(100\% - 15\% = 85\%\)).

Mathematically, the remaining value after one year can be expressed as:
\[
\text{New Value} = \text{Old Value} \times 0.85
\]

---

### **Step 2: Apply the depreciation formula for multiple years**
If the car starts with an initial value of $20,000, we can calculate its value after 3 years using the following formula for exponential depreciation:
\[
V = P \times (1 - r)^t
\]
Where:
- \(V\) is the value of the car after \(t\) years.
- \(P\) is the initial value of the car (\$20,000 in this case).
- \(r\) is the annual depreciation rate (15%, or 0.15 as a decimal).
- \(t\) is the number of years (3 years in this case).

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[
V = 20000 \times (1 - 0.15)^3
\]
\[
V = 20000 \times (0.85)^3
\]

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the value step by step**
Now, let’s compute \(0.85^3\):
\[
0.85^3 = 0.85 \times 0.85 \times 0.85 = 0.614125
\]

Next, multiply this result by the initial value (\$20,000):
\[
V = 20000 \times 0.614125 = 12282.5
\]

---

### **Step 4: Final Answer**
After 3 years, the car will be worth approximately **\$12,282.50**.

---

### **Optional: Verify with Year-by-Year Calculation**
If you prefer to verify the result year by year, here’s how it works:

1. **Year 1**: 
   \[
   \text{Value after Year 1} = 20000 \times 0.85 = 17000
   \]

2. **Year 2**: 
   \[
   \text{Value after Year 2} = 17000 \times 0.85 = 14450
   \]

3. **Year 3**: 
   \[
   \text{Value after Year 3} = 14450 \times 0.85 = 12282.5
   \]

This confirms our earlier calculation. 

Thus, the car's value after 3 years is **\$12,282.50**."

Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Ratios
- The first ratio is **3 apples to 2 oranges**. This means for every 3 apples, there are 2 oranges.
- The second ratio is **6 apples to 4 oranges**, which is equivalent to the first ratio because both can be simplified to \( \frac{3}{2} \).

---

### Step 2: Draw the First Set of Fruits (3 Apples to 2 Oranges)

   - For example, use red circles for apples and orange circles for oranges.
2. **Draw the fruits**:
   - Draw **3 apples** (e.g., 3 red circles).
   - Draw **2 oranges** (e.g., 2 orange circles).
3. **Group them together**: Clearly separate the apples and oranges in your drawing so that the ratio is visually apparent.

---

### Step 3: Draw the Second Set of Fruits (6 Apples to 4 Oranges)
1. Since this ratio is equivalent to the first one, follow the same process but double the quantities:
   - Draw **6 apples** (e.g., 6 red circles).
   - Draw **4 oranges** (e.g., 4 orange circles).
2. Group these fruits together as well.

---

### Step 4: Label Your Diagrams
- Clearly label each set of fruits with their respective ratios:
  - First set: ""3 apples : 2 oranges""
  - Second set: ""6 apples : 4 oranges""

---

### Step 5: Show Equivalence
- Explain or indicate visually that the second set is simply a scaled-up version of the first set. For example:
  - You could write a note saying, ""The second set is twice the size of the first set, but the ratio remains the same.""

---

### Example Visual Representation

Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Ratio
The given ratio is **5 blue blocks to 3 yellow blocks**. This means for every group of blocks you create, there should be 5 blue blocks and 3 yellow blocks.

---

### Step 2: Build the Model
Using your blocks:
- Take **5 blue blocks**.
- Take **3 yellow blocks**.
- Arrange them in a way that clearly shows the relationship between the two colors (e.g., side by side or in separate groups).

This is your first model representing the ratio **5:3**.

---

### Step 3: Find an Equivalent Ratio
An **equivalent ratio** is one where the relationship between the numbers remains the same, but the quantities are scaled up or down by multiplying or dividing both parts of the ratio by the same number.

For example:
- Multiply both numbers in the ratio **5:3** by **2**:
  - \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \)
  - \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \)
  - The equivalent ratio is **10:6**.

Alternatively:
- Multiply both numbers in the ratio **5:3** by **3**:
  - \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
  - \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \)
  - The equivalent ratio is **15:9**.

Choose one of these equivalent ratios to illustrate.

---

### Step 4: Illustrate the Equivalent Ratio
Using your blocks again:
- For the equivalent ratio **10:6**, take **10 blue blocks** and **6 yellow blocks**.
- Arrange them similarly to how you arranged the original ratio, ensuring it’s clear that the new grouping represents the same proportional relationship.

---

### Step 5: Verify the Ratios
To confirm that the ratios are equivalent, simplify each ratio:
- Original ratio: \( \frac{5}{3} \) (already simplified).
- Equivalent ratio (e.g., **10:6**): \( \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \) when simplified.

Both ratios simplify to the same fraction, proving they are equivalent.

---

### Final Answer:
You have now built a model representing the ratio **5:3** and illustrated an equivalent ratio, such as **10:6**. 

If you choose to use **10:6** as your equivalent ratio, your final answer would look like this:

$$
\boxed{\text{Original Ratio: } 5:3 \text{, Equivalent Ratio: } 10:6}

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Linear and other simple functions","D","Create a table of values for the linear function y = 2x + 3 then plot the points on a graph and describe the slope.","To solve this task, we will break it into three main steps: creating a table of values, plotting the points on a graph, and describing the slope. Let’s go through each step in detail.

---

### **Step 1: Create a Table of Values**
The given linear function is \( y = 2x + 3 \). This equation tells us that for any value of \( x \), we can calculate the corresponding value of \( y \) by substituting \( x \) into the equation.

#### Steps to create the table:
1. Choose several values for \( x \). It's common to pick both positive and negative integers, as well as zero.
2. Substitute each \( x \)-value into the equation \( y = 2x + 3 \) to find the corresponding \( y \)-value.
3. Record the results in a table with two columns: one for \( x \) and one for \( y \).

Here’s an example table:

| \( x \) | \( y = 2x + 3 \) |
|---------|-------------------|
| -2      | \( 2(-2) + 3 = -4 + 3 = -1 \) |
| -1      | \( 2(-1) + 3 = -2 + 3 = 1 \) |
| 0       | \( 2(0) + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3 \) |
| 1       | \( 2(1) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \) |
| 2       | \( 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7 \) |

So the table looks like this:

| \( x \) | \( y \) |
|---------|---------|
| -2      | -1      |
| -1      | 1       |
| 0       | 3       |
| 1       | 5       |
| 2       | 7       |

---

### **Step 2: Plot the Points on a Graph**
Now that we have our table of values, we can plot the points on a coordinate plane.

#### Steps to plot the points:
1. Draw a Cartesian coordinate plane with an \( x \)-axis (horizontal) and a \( y \)-axis (vertical).
2. For each pair of \( (x, y) \) values from the table, locate the point on the graph:
   - For \( (-2, -1) \): Move 2 units left from the origin and 1 unit down.
   - For \( (-1, 1) \): Move 1 unit left from the origin and 1 unit up.
   - For \( (0, 3) \): Stay at the origin horizontally and move 3 units up.
   - For \( (1, 5) \): Move 1 unit right from the origin and 5 units up.
   - For \( (2, 7) \): Move 2 units right from the origin and 7 units up.
3. Mark each point with a dot.
4. Connect the dots with a straight line, since the function \( y = 2x + 3 \) is linear.

---

### **Step 3: Describe the Slope**
The slope of a linear function describes how steep the line is and whether it rises or falls as you move from left to right. The slope is represented by \( m \) in the equation \( y = mx + b \).

#### Steps to describe the slope:
1. Identify \( m \) from the equation \( y = 2x + 3 \). Here, \( m = 2 \).
2. Interpret the slope:
   - A slope of \( 2 \) means that for every 1 unit increase in \( x \), \( y \) increases by 2 units.
   - Since \( m > 0 \), the line slopes upward as you move from left to right.

#### Additional Notes:
- The slope can also be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
  \]
  Using two points from the table, such as \( (0, 3) \) and \( (1, 5) \):
  \[
  m = \frac{5 - 3}{1 - 0} = \frac{2}{1} = 2
  \]

---

### Final Answer:
- **Table of Values**:
  \[
  \begin{array}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  x & y \\
  \hline
  -2 & -1 \\
  -1 & 1 \\
  0 & 3 \\
  1 & 5 \\
  2 & 7 \\
  \hline
  \end{array}
  \]

- **Graph**: Plot the points \( (-2, -1) \), \( (-1, 1) \), \( (0, 3) \), \( (1, 5) \), and \( (2, 7) \), then connect them with a straight line.

- **Slope Description**: The slope is \( m = 2 \), meaning the line rises by 2 units for every 1 unit increase in \( x \). The line slopes upward as \( x \) increases.

---

### **1. Write the Equation**
The gym charges:
- A one-time registration fee of $20.
- $10 per month.

The total cost (C) depends on the number of months (m) you are enrolled. The relationship between the total cost and the number of months can be expressed as:

$$
C = 20 + 10m
$$

Here:
- $C$ is the total cost in dollars.
- $m$ is the number of months.
- $20$ is the fixed one-time registration fee.
- $10m$ represents the monthly fee multiplied by the number of months.

So, the equation for the total cost is:

$$
\boxed{C = 20 + 10m}
$$

---

### **2. Create a Table of Values**
To create a table of values, choose several values for $m$ (number of months), substitute them into the equation $C = 20 + 10m$, and calculate the corresponding $C$ (total cost).

| $m$ (Months) | Calculation ($C = 20 + 10m$) | $C$ (Total Cost) |
|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| 0              | $C = 20 + 10(0)$             | 20                 |
| 1              | $C = 20 + 10(1)$             | 30                 |
| 2              | $C = 20 + 10(2)$             | 40                 |
| 3              | $C = 20 + 10(3)$             | 50                 |
| 4              | $C = 20 + 10(4)$             | 60                 |
| 5              | $C = 20 + 10(5)$             | 70                 |

So, the table looks like this:

| $m$ (Months) | $C$ (Total Cost) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 0             | 20                |
| 1             | 30                |
| 2             | 40                |
| 3             | 50                |

| 5             | 70                |

---

### **3. Graph the Function**
To graph the function $C = 20 + 10m$, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the type of function**: This is a linear function because it has the form $C = mx + b$, where $m = 10$ (the slope) and $b = 20$ (the y-intercept).
   
2. **Plot the points from the table**:
   - When $m = 0$, $C = 20$. Plot the point $(0, 20)$.
   - When $m = 1$, $C = 30$. Plot the point $(1, 30)$.
   - When $m = 2$, $C = 40$. Plot the point $(2, 40)$.
   - Continue plotting the remaining points: $(3, 50)$, $(4, 60)$, and $(5, 70)$.

3. **Draw the line**: Connect the points with a straight line. Since the function is linear, the graph will be a straight line that starts at $(0, 20)$ and increases as $m$ increases.

---

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Linear and other simple functions","D","If a bike rental shop charges $5 for the first hour and $2 for each additional hour find the linear function that represents the cost (C) based on hours (h) plot it and explain the meaning of the slope.","To solve this task, we will break it down into several steps: deriving the linear function, plotting it, and explaining the meaning of the slope.

---

### **Step 1: Derive the Linear Function**

The bike rental shop charges:
- **$5 for the first hour** (this is a fixed cost).
- **$2 for each additional hour** (this is a variable cost).

Let:
- \( h \) = total hours rented.
- \( C(h) \) = total cost in dollars.

#### Case Analysis:
1. For \( h = 1 \):
   - The cost is just $5 because there are no additional hours.
   - So, \( C(1) = 5 \).

2. For \( h > 1 \):
   - The cost includes the initial $5 for the first hour and $2 for each additional hour.
   - The number of additional hours is \( h - 1 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost is:
     \[
     C(h) = 5 + 2(h - 1)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     C(h) = 5 + 2h - 2
     \]
     \[
     C(h) = 2h + 3
     \]

Thus, the linear function that represents the cost is:
\[
C(h) = 2h + 3
\]

---

### **Step 2: Plot the Function**

To plot \( C(h) = 2h + 3 \), follow these steps:

1. Identify key points:
   - When \( h = 0 \): \( C(0) = 2(0) + 3 = 3 \). So, the point is \( (0, 3) \).
   - When \( h = 1 \): \( C(1) = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \). So, the point is \( (1, 5) \).
   - When \( h = 2 \): \( C(2) = 2(2) + 3 = 7 \). So, the point is \( (2, 7) \).
   - When \( h = 3 \): \( C(3) = 2(3) + 3 = 9 \). So, the point is \( (3, 9) \).

2. Plot these points on a graph with \( h \) (hours) on the x-axis and \( C(h) \) (cost) on the y-axis.

3. Draw a straight line through the points to represent the linear relationship.

---

### **Step 3: Explain the Meaning of the Slope**

The slope of a linear function \( C(h) = mh + b \) is given by \( m \). In this case:
\[
m = 2
\]

The slope represents the **rate of change of the cost with respect to the number of hours**. Specifically:
- A slope of \( 2 \) means that for every additional hour (\( h \)), the cost increases by $2.
- This corresponds directly to the rental shop's pricing structure, where they charge $2 for each additional hour after the first hour.

---

### **Summary**

1. The linear function representing the cost is:
   \[
   C(h) = 2h + 3
   \]

2. To plot the function, identify key points such as \( (0, 3) \), \( (1, 5) \), \( (2, 7) \), and \( (3, 9) \), and draw a straight line through them.

3. The slope of the function is \( 2 \), which means the cost increases by $2 for every additional hour rented.

Solve for x in the equation x + 12 = 45.","To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the situation and break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The video game designer currently has **45 points**. If he earns **12 more points**, we are tasked with figuring out how many points he **started with**. This is represented by the equation:

\[
x + 12 = 45
\]

Here:
- \( x \) represents the number of points the designer started with.
- The \( +12 \) accounts for the additional points he earned.
- The total is given as \( 45 \).

Our goal is to solve for \( x \), which represents the starting points.

---

### Step 2: Solve the Equation
We need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract \( 12 \) from both sides of the equation:

\[

Solve for x in the equation x + 75 = 250.","To solve the problem of how much more money Maria needs to save, we can use the equation \( x + 75 = 250 \). Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the equation
The equation \( x + 75 = 250 \) represents the total amount Maria needs to save. In this equation:
- \( x \) is the additional amount of money Maria needs to save.
- \( 75 \) is the amount of money Maria already has.
- \( 250 \) is the total cost of the bike.

We need to find the value of \( x \).

---

### Step 2: Isolate \( x \)
To isolate \( x \), subtract \( 75 \) from both sides of the equation. This keeps the equation balanced and simplifies it:

\[
x + 75 - 75 = 250 - 75
\]

Simplify both sides:

\[
x = 175
\]

---

### Step 3: Verify the solution
To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 175 \) back into the original equation:

\[
175 + 75 = 250
\]

Since \( 250 = 250 \), the solution is correct.

### Part 1: Understanding the Temperature Problem
The initial temperature outside is **20 degrees Celsius**. If the temperature increases by **15 degrees**, we can calculate the new temperature as follows:

\[
\text{New Temperature} = \text{Initial Temperature} + \text{Increase}

So, the new temperature will be **35 degrees Celsius**.

---

### Part 2: Solving the Equation \(x - 15 = 20\)
Now, let's focus on solving the equation \(x - 15 = 20\) for \(x\). Here's how to approach it:

#### Step 1: Isolate \(x\)
To isolate \(x\), we need to eliminate \(-15\) from the left-hand side of the equation. To do this, add 15 to both sides of the equation:

\[
x - 15 + 15 = 20 + 15
\]

Simplify both sides:

\[
x = 35

#### Step 2: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \(x = 35\) back into the original equation:

\[
35 - 15 = 20
\]

This is true, so the solution is correct.

So, the differences between consecutive terms are:
\[ 4, 6, 8 \]

---

### Step 3: Check if the differences form a pattern
Now, observe the differences \( 4, 6, 8 \). These numbers increase by \( 2 \) each time:
- \( 6 - 4 = 2 \)
- \( 8 - 6 = 2 \)

This indicates that the differences themselves form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of \( 2 \).

---

### Step 4: Predict the next difference
Since the differences increase by \( 2 \), the next difference after \( 8 \) will be:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the next term in the sequence
To find the next term in the sequence, add this new difference (\( 10 \)) to the last term in the sequence (\( 21 \)):
\[ 21 + 10 = 31 \]

---

### Step 6: Verify the pattern
Let’s confirm the pattern holds for all terms:
- Start with \( 3 \).
- Add \( 4 \): \( 3 + 4 = 7 \)
- Add \( 6 \): \( 7 + 6 = 13 \)
- Add \( 8 \): \( 13 + 8 = 21 \)
- Add \( 10 \): \( 21 + 10 = 31 \)

The pattern is consistent.

---

### Final Answer:
The next term in the sequence is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]

---

### Explanation of the Pattern:
The sequence \( 3, 7, 13, 21, \dots \) is generated by starting with \( 3 \) and adding consecutive even numbers (\( 4, 6, 8, 10, \dots \)). This results in a quadratic relationship for the terms of the sequence."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Other functional relationships","F","If a savings account starts with $100 and increases by $15 each month what will be the balance after the 6th month?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the problem
You are given:
- The initial balance of the savings account is **$100**.
- Each month, the account increases by **$15**.
- You need to find the balance after the **6th month**.

This is a straightforward arithmetic problem where the balance grows linearly over time.

---

### Step 2: Identify the formula for the balance
The balance in the account after a certain number of months can be calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{Balance} = \text{Initial Balance} + (\text{Monthly Increase} \times \text{Number of Months})
\]

Here:
- **Initial Balance** = $100
- **Monthly Increase** = $15
- **Number of Months** = 6

---

### Step 3: Plug in the values
Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[
\text{Balance} = 100 + (15 \times 6)
\]

First, calculate the total increase over 6 months:

\[
15 \times 6 = 90
\]

Now, add this increase to the initial balance:

\[
\text{Balance} = 100 + 90 = 190
\]

---

### Step 4: State the final answer
The balance in the savings account after the 6th month will be **$190**.

---

### Optional: Verify with a step-by-step approach
If you want to double-check, you can calculate the balance month by month:
- Start: $100
- After 1st month: $100 + $15 = $115
- After 2nd month: $115 + $15 = $130
- After 3rd month: $130 + $15 = $145
- After 4th month: $145 + $15 = $160
- After 5th month: $160 + $15 = $175
- After 6th month: $175 + $15 = $190

This confirms that the balance after the 6th month is indeed **$190**."

---

### Step 1: Understand what triangular numbers are.
Triangular numbers represent the total number of dots that can form an equilateral triangle. For example:
- The first triangular number is 1 (a single dot).
- The second triangular number is 3 (three dots forming a triangle with two rows).
- The third triangular number is 6 (six dots forming a triangle with three rows), and so on.

The nth triangular number can be calculated using the formula:
\[
T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
where \( T_n \) is the nth triangular number, and \( n \) is the position of the number in the sequence.

---

### Step 2: Identify the pattern in the given sequence.
The sequence provided is: 1, 3, 6, 10.

Let’s analyze how each number is derived:
- The first number is \( T_1 = 1 \).
- The second number is \( T_2 = 3 \).
- The third number is \( T_3 = 6 \).
- The fourth number is \( T_4 = 10 \).

Notice that each number is obtained by adding consecutive integers:
- \( T_1 = 1 \)
- \( T_2 = T_1 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 \)
- \( T_3 = T_2 + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \)
- \( T_4 = T_3 + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)

From this, we see that the next triangular number will be obtained by adding the next integer (5) to \( T_4 \).

---

### Step 3: Calculate the next number in the sequence.
Using the pattern identified:
\[
T_5 = T_4 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15
\]

Thus, the next number in the sequence is **15**.

---

### Step 4: Verify using the formula.
We can also verify this result using the formula for triangular numbers:
\[
T_5 = \frac{5(5+1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 6}{2} = 15
\]

This confirms that the fifth triangular number is indeed 15.

Here's how you can approach this step by step:

---

### Step 1: Analyze the Sequence
The sequence provided is:
\[ 3, 7, 11, 15 \]

We observe that the numbers increase consistently. To determine if there is a pattern, calculate the differences between consecutive terms:
- \( 7 - 3 = 4 \)
- \( 11 - 7 = 4 \)
- \( 15 - 11 = 4 \)

Since the difference between consecutive terms is constant (\( +4 \)), this sequence is an **arithmetic sequence**.

---

### Step 2: General Formula for an Arithmetic Sequence
The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d
\]
where:
- \( a_n \) is the \( n \)-th term,
- \( a_1 \) is the first term,
- \( d \) is the common difference,
- \( n \) is the position of the term in the sequence.

From the sequence:
- The first term \( a_1 = 3 \),
- The common difference \( d = 4 \).

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
a_n = 3 + (n - 1) \cdot 4
\]

Simplify the formula:
\[
a_n = 3 + 4n - 4
\]
\[
a_n = 4n - 1
\]

Thus, the algebraic rule governing the sequence is:
\[
a_n = 4n - 1

---

### Step 3: Find the 8th Term
To find the 8th term (\( a_8 \)), substitute \( n = 8 \) into the formula:
\[
a_8 = 4(8) - 1
\]
\[
a_8 = 32 - 1

\[
a_8 = 31

Let's break this down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Sequence
The given sequence of perfect squares is:
\[ 1, 4, 9, 16, \dots \]

This sequence represents the squares of positive integers:
- \( 1 = 1^2 \)
- \( 4 = 2^2 \)
- \( 9 = 3^2 \)
- \( 16 = 4^2 \)

Thus, the \( n \)-th term corresponds to the square of the \( n \)-th positive integer.

---

### Step 2: Derive the Algebraic Expression
From the pattern above, we observe that the \( n \)-th term in the sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = n^2
\]
where \( a_n \) represents the \( n \)-th term of the sequence.

So, the algebraic expression for the \( n \)-th term is:
\[
\boxed{a_n = n^2}

Thus, the 6th term of the sequence is:
\[
\boxed{36}

---

### **Part 1: Finding the 10th Term**

The general formula for the sequence is given as:
\[
a_n = 5n - 2
\]
Here, \( n \) represents the position of the term in the sequence.

To find the 10th term (\( a_{10} \)), substitute \( n = 10 \) into the formula:
\[
a_{10} = 5(10) - 2
\]
Simplify the expression:
\[
a_{10} = 50 - 2 = 48
\]

Thus, the 10th term of the sequence is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]

---

### **Part 2: Sum of the First 5 Terms**

The sum of the first \( k \) terms of a sequence can be calculated by adding up the individual terms. For this sequence, the first 5 terms are:
\[
a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5
\]

Using the formula \( a_n = 5n - 2 \), calculate each term individually:

- For \( n = 1 \):
\[
a_1 = 5(1) - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3
\]

- For \( n = 2 \):
\[
a_2 = 5(2) - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8
\]

- For \( n = 3 \):
\[
a_3 = 5(3) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13
\]

- For \( n = 4 \):
\[
a_4 = 5(4) - 2 = 20 - 2 = 18
\]

- For \( n = 5 \):
\[
a_5 = 5(5) - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
\]

Now, add these terms together to find the sum of the first 5 terms:
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 3 + 8 + 13 + 18 + 23
\]

Perform the addition step-by-step:
\[
3 + 8 = 11
\]
\[
11 + 13 = 24
\]
\[
24 + 18 = 42
\]
\[
42 + 23 = 65
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 5 terms is:
\[
\boxed{65}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
- The 10th term is \( \boxed{48} \).
- The sum of the first 5 terms is \( \boxed{65} \)."

This involves setting up a proportion and solving it step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the relationship between flour and cookies**:
   - The recipe states that 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies.
   - This means the ratio of flour to cookies is \( \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \).

2. **Set up the proportion**:
   - You want to find out how many cups of flour (\( x \)) are needed for 30 cookies.
   - The proportion can be written as:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
     \]

3. **Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \)**:
   - Cross-multiplying gives:
     \[
     2 \times 30 = 12 \times x
     \]
     \[
     60 = 12x
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 12:
     \[
     x = \frac{60}{12}
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

### Final Answer:
You would need **5 cups of flour** to make 30 cookies.

---

### Alternative Method: Unitary Method

If you prefer a simpler approach, you can calculate how much flour is needed for one cookie and then scale it up to 30 cookies:

1. Flour per cookie:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup per cookie}
   \]

2. Flour for 30 cookies:
   \[
   30 \times \frac{1}{6} = 5 \text{ cups}
   \]

This confirms that the answer is still **5 cups of flour**."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","H","A car travels 240 miles on 8 gallons of gas; how many gallons of gas would be required to travel 600 miles?","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many gallons of gas are required for the car to travel 600 miles, given that it travels 240 miles on 8 gallons of gas. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Determine the car's fuel efficiency (miles per gallon)
The car travels **240 miles** using **8 gallons** of gas. To find the car's fuel efficiency (miles per gallon), divide the total distance traveled by the total gallons of gas used:

\[
\text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Gallons}} = \frac{240}{8} = 30 \, \text{miles per gallon (mpg)}.
\]

So, the car can travel **30 miles** on **1 gallon** of gas.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of gallons needed for 600 miles
Now that we know the car's fuel efficiency is **30 miles per gallon**, we can calculate how many gallons are needed to travel **600 miles**. Use the formula:

\[
\text{Gallons Required} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Fuel Efficiency}} = \frac{600}{30} = 20 \, \text{gallons}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The car would require **20 gallons** of gas to travel 600 miles.

---

### Verification:
To ensure the calculation is correct, check if 20 gallons of gas at 30 miles per gallon equals 600 miles:

\[
20 \, \text{gallons} \times 30 \, \text{miles per gallon} = 600 \, \text{miles}.
\]

This confirms our solution is accurate.

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","H","If a poster is designed to be 4 feet wide and 6 feet tall what would be the width of a poster that is 10 feet tall while maintaining the same proportions?","To solve this problem, you need to maintain the same proportions between the width and height of the original poster when scaling it to a new size. Here's how you can approach the problem step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the given proportions
The original poster has a width of **4 feet** and a height of **6 feet**. This means the ratio of width to height is:

\[
\text{Width-to-Height Ratio} = \frac{\text{Width}}{\text{Height}} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

So, for any scaled version of the poster, the width must always be \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height.

---

### Step 2: Set up the proportion for the new dimensions
You are tasked with finding the width of a poster that is **10 feet tall**, while keeping the same proportions. Let the unknown width of the new poster be \(x\) feet. Using the same width-to-height ratio (\(\frac{2}{3}\)), we set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{x}{10} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \(x\)
To find \(x\), cross-multiply and solve the equation:

\[
3x = 2 \cdot 10
\]

\[
3x = 20
\]

\[
x = \frac{20}{3}
\]

\[
x \approx 6.67 \, \text{feet}
\]

---

### Step 4: Verify the result
The width of the new poster is approximately **6.67 feet**. To check if the proportions are maintained, calculate the ratio of the new width to the new height:

\[
\frac{x}{10} = \frac{6.67}{10} = 0.667 \, (\text{or } \frac{2}{3})
\]

This matches the original ratio of \(\frac{2}{3}\), so the solution is correct.

### Step 1: Understand the 4 Times Table
The 4 times table consists of numbers that are multiples of 4. These numbers are generated by multiplying 4 with consecutive integers starting from 1:
- \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \)
- \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)
- \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \)
- \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \)
- \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \), and so on.

So, the sequence is: **4, 8, 12, 16, 20, ...**

### Step 2: Identify the Pattern
Looking at the sequence, we can observe the following:
1. Each number in the sequence increases by **4** compared to the previous number.
   - \( 8 - 4 = 4 \)
   - \( 12 - 8 = 4 \)
   - \( 16 - 12 = 4 \), and so on.
2. The sequence follows a consistent addition of 4, which means it is an **arithmetic sequence** with a common difference of 4.

---

### Step 1: Understand the 5 Times Table
The 5 times table consists of the multiples of 5:
$$
5 \times 1 = 5, \quad 5 \times 2 = 10, \quad 5 \times 3 = 15, \quad 5 \times 4 = 20, \quad \text{and so on.}
$$
Notice a pattern in the results:
- Every multiple of 5 ends in either **0** or **5**.
- The numbers increase by 5 as you move through the table.

---

### Step 2: Relate the Problem to the 5 Times Table
You are tasked with finding $ 5 \times 12 $. This means you need to determine the 12th multiple of 5 in the 5 times table.

---

### Step 3: Use Known Patterns in the 5 Times Table
Instead of manually calculating all the way up to $ 5 \times 12 $, you can use these strategies:

#### Strategy 1: Break It Down Using Smaller Multiples
If you know smaller multiples of 5, you can build up to $ 5 \times 12 $:
$$
5 \times 10 = 50 \quad \text{(this is a known fact from the 5 times table)}.
$$
Now add two more groups of 5 (since $ 12 = 10 + 2 $):
$$
5 \times 2 = 10.
$$
So,
$$
5 \times 12 = (5 \times 10) + (5 \times 2) = 50 + 10 = 60.
$$

#### Strategy 2: Use Doubling and Halving
Since $ 5 \times 12 $ is the same as $ 10 \times 6 $ (because multiplying by 5 is the same as multiplying by 10 and then dividing by 2), you can calculate:
$$
10 \times 6 = 60.
$$
Then divide by 2:
$$
60 \div 2 = 60.
$$

#### Strategy 3: Count by 5s
If you're comfortable counting by 5s, you can count up to the 12th multiple:
$$
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60.
$$
The 12th number in this sequence is 60.

---

### Step 4: Final Answer
Using any of the above strategies, you can quickly determine that:
$$

---

### Step 1: Define the variables
We are tasked with finding the cost of the pencil, which we'll denote as \( p \). Let the cost of the notebook be \( n \).

---

### Step 2: Translate the relationships into equations
The problem gives us two key pieces of information:

1. **A pencil costs $2 less than a notebook**:  
   This means the cost of the pencil \( p \) is \( n - 2 \). So, we can write:
   \[
   p = n - 2
   \]

2. **Together they cost $6**:  
   The total cost of the pencil and the notebook is $6. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   p + n = 6
   \]

---

### Step 3: Substitute one equation into the other
From the first equation (\( p = n - 2 \)), substitute \( p \) in the second equation (\( p + n = 6 \)):

\[
(n - 2) + n = 6
\]

Simplify this equation:
\[
2n - 2 = 6
\]

---

### Step 4: Solve for \( n \)
Add 2 to both sides:
\[
2n = 8
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
n = 4
\]

So, the cost of the notebook is $4.

---

### Step 5: Find \( p \)
Now that we know \( n = 4 \), substitute \( n \) back into the equation \( p = n - 2 \):

\[
p = 4 - 2
\]

\[
p = 2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The cost of the pencil is \( \boxed{2} \).

---

### Summary of the Equation:
The equation you need to solve is:
\[
p + (p + 2) = 6
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2p + 2 = 6
\]
And solving this will give you \( p = 2 \)."

The problem states that together, Sarah and Tim have 24 stickers. This means the sum of their stickers is 24. Using the variables we defined:
\[
t + 2t = 24
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:
\[
3t = 24
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( t \)
To isolate \( t \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
t = \frac{24}{3} = 8
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result
Tim has \( t = 8 \) stickers. Since Sarah has twice as many stickers as Tim, Sarah has:
\[
2t = 2(8) = 16 \text{ stickers}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The equation to determine the number of stickers Tim has is:
\[
t + 2t = 24
\]
And solving it gives:
\[
\boxed{t = 8}

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Equations and algebra","E","A fruit basket contains x apples and if 5 apples are added there will be a total of 15 apples; write an equation to find the initial number of apples in the basket.","Certainly! Let's break this problem down step by step to understand how to solve it and write the equation.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We are told that a fruit basket initially contains **x apples**. If **5 more apples** are added to the basket, the total number of apples becomes **15**. Our goal is to find the initial number of apples in the basket, which is represented by **x**.

### Step 2: Translate the Problem into an Equation
To represent this situation mathematically, we can use the following logic:
- Initially, there are **x apples**.
- When **5 apples** are added, the total becomes **15 apples**.

This relationship can be written as:
$$
x + 5 = 15
$$

Here:
- **x** represents the initial number of apples.
- **+5** accounts for the 5 apples being added.
- **=15** represents the total number of apples after adding the 5 apples.

### Step 3: Solve the Equation
Now that we have the equation, let's solve for **x**:
$$
x + 5 = 15
$$

To isolate **x**, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
$$
x = 15 - 5
$$

Simplify:
$$
x = 10
$$

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, substitute **x = 10** back into the original problem:
- Initially, there are **10 apples**.
- Adding **5 apples** gives:
$$
10 + 5 = 15
$$

This matches the condition given in the problem, so the solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The equation to find the initial number of apples is:
$$
\boxed{x + 5 = 15}
$$

And the initial number of apples is:
$$
\boxed{10}

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Recognizing patterns and structures","B","Create a repeating pattern using red blue and yellow colored squares where you use each color in a total of three times.","To solve the task of creating a repeating pattern using red, blue, and yellow squares where each color is used exactly three times, let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- You have **three colors**: red, blue, and yellow.
- Each color must appear **exactly three times** in the pattern.
- The pattern should be **repeating**, meaning it can loop seamlessly.

This means you need to create a sequence of squares (or tiles) that satisfies these constraints. The total number of squares in your pattern will be:
\[
3 \text{ (red)} + 3 \text{ (blue)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 9 \text{ squares}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Design the Pattern
You need to arrange the squares in such a way that the pattern looks balanced and can repeat seamlessly. Here are some considerations:
- Avoid placing all squares of one color together (e.g., RRR BBB YYY), as this might not look visually appealing or repetitive.
- Aim for a balanced distribution of the colors.

One possible arrangement could be:
\[
R, B, Y, R, B, Y, R, B, Y
\]
This creates a simple repeating sequence where the colors alternate evenly.

Another possibility could be:
\[
R, B, R, Y, B, Y, R, B, Y
\]
Here, the colors are still distributed evenly but with a slightly different rhythm.

---

### Step 3: Verify the Pattern
Check that:
1. Each color appears exactly three times.
2. The pattern can repeat seamlessly. For example, if you copy the sequence after itself, the transition between the end and the start should look natural.

For the first example (\(R, B, Y, R, B, Y, R, B, Y\)):
- Red appears 3 times.
- Blue appears 3 times.
- Yellow appears 3 times.
- The sequence repeats perfectly because the last square (Y) connects naturally to the first square (R).

For the second example (\(R, B, R, Y, B, Y, R, B, Y\)):
- Red appears 3 times.
- Blue appears 3 times.
- Yellow appears 3 times.
- The sequence also repeats seamlessly.

---

### Step 4: Visualize the Pattern
If you're working with physical squares or digital tools, lay out the squares in the chosen sequence. Ensure the colors align correctly and the pattern looks balanced.

---

### Final Answer
A valid repeating pattern is:
\[
\boxed{R, B, Y, R, B, Y, R, B, Y}
\]
Alternatively:
\[
\boxed{R, B, R, Y, B, Y, R, B, Y}

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Requirements**
- You need to use **two different shapes**: circles and triangles.
- The shapes must **alternate**, meaning one shape should follow the other in a repeating sequence.
- The alternation must occur **at least five times**. This means the sequence should include at least five transitions between the two shapes.

---

### **Step 2: Plan the Pattern**
Decide on the layout of the pattern. For example:
- Will the shapes be arranged in a straight line?
- Will they form a grid or a circular arrangement?
- Will they overlap or be spaced apart?

For simplicity, let’s assume the shapes will be arranged in a straight horizontal line.

---

### **Step 3: Create the Alternating Sequence**
Start by alternating the shapes in a sequence. Since the alternation must occur at least five times, the sequence could look like this:
1. Circle → Triangle → Circle → Triangle → Circle → Triangle → Circle → Triangle → Circle

This sequence includes **five transitions** (Circle → Triangle and Triangle → Circle).

If you want to make the pattern longer, you can continue alternating as needed.

---

### **Step 4: Draw the Shapes**
Using a pencil, pen, or digital drawing tool:
1. Draw the first circle.
2. Next to it, draw a triangle.
3. Continue alternating between circles and triangles until you have completed the required number of transitions.

Ensure the shapes are evenly spaced and clearly distinguishable.

---

### **Step 5: Verify the Pattern**
Check your work to ensure:
- The shapes alternate correctly.
- There are at least five transitions between the shapes.

---

### **Optional Enhancements**
To make the pattern more visually interesting, you can:
- Vary the sizes of the shapes.
- Use different colors for the circles and triangles.
- Arrange the shapes in a more complex layout, such as a zigzag or spiral.

---

### **Example**
Here’s an example of what the pattern might look like in text format:
```
○ △ ○ △ ○ △ ○ △ ○
```
In this example:
- ""○"" represents a circle.
- ""△"" represents a triangle.
- The alternation occurs five times (each transition is marked by a change from ○ to △ or △ to ○).

If you’re drawing this on paper, replace the symbols with actual shapes.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Requirements**
1. **Two Colors**: You are limited to using only two distinct colors, say Color A and Color B.
2. **Three Sections**: The pattern must be divided into three distinct sections.
3. **Same Color Order**: Each section must follow the same sequence or arrangement of the two colors.

---

### **Step 2: Define the Color Order**
Since there are only two colors, the simplest repeating sequence is alternating between them. For example:
- **Color Order**: A → B (or B → A).

This means each section will alternate between the two colors in the same way.

---

### **Step 3: Design the Pattern**
Divide the pattern into three sections, and apply the same color order to each section. Here's how you can do it:

#### **Option 1: Horizontal Sections**
If the pattern is horizontal, divide it into three equal horizontal strips:
- **Section 1**: Start with Color A, followed by Color B.
- **Section 2**: Repeat the same order: Color A, followed by Color B.
- **Section 3**: Again, repeat the same order: Color A, followed by Color B.

#### **Option 2: Vertical Sections**
If the pattern is vertical, divide it into three equal vertical columns:
- **Column 1**: Start with Color A, followed by Color B.
- **Column 2**: Repeat the same order: Color A, followed by Color B.
- **Column 3**: Again, repeat the same order: Color A, followed by Color B.

#### **Option 3: Grid Layout**
If the pattern is a grid, divide it into three rows or columns, and apply the same alternating color order to each row or column.

---

### **Step 4: Visualize the Pattern**
Here’s an example of what the pattern might look like if represented as a grid:

```
Section 1: A B
Section 2: A B
Section 3: A B
```

Or in a more visual format:

```
A B   A B   A B
B A   B A   B A
```

In this example:
- Each ""A B"" pair represents one section.
- The same color order (A → B) is applied to all three sections.

---

### **Step 5: Verify the Solution**
Ensure that:
1. Only two colors are used.
2. There are three distinct sections.
3. Each section follows the exact same color order.

If all these conditions are satisfied, your pattern is complete!

---

### **Final Answer**
You can design the pattern by dividing it into three sections and applying the same alternating color order (e.g., A → B) to each section. This ensures consistency across all sections while adhering to the constraints of using only two colors."

### Step 1: Write down the given sequence
The sequence is: **5, 10, 15, 20**

### Step 2: Look for a pattern
We observe that each number in the sequence increases by a constant value. To confirm this:
- From 5 to 10: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- From 10 to 15: \( 15 - 10 = 5 \)
- From 15 to 20: \( 20 - 15 = 5 \)

Thus, the difference between consecutive terms is consistently **5**. This means the sequence is an **arithmetic sequence** with a common difference of 5.

### Step 3: Determine the next number
To find the next number in the sequence, add the common difference (5) to the last term (20):
\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, the next number in the sequence is **25**.

### Step 4: Determine the next two numbers
Following the same logic, continue adding 5 to each subsequent term:
- After 25: \( 25 + 5 = 30 \)
- After 30: \( 30 + 5 = 35 \)

Thus, the next two numbers in the sequence are **30** and **35**.

### Step 1: Analyze the given sequence
The sequence provided is:
2, 4, 8, 16

### Step 2: Identify the relationship between consecutive terms
To find the pattern, we look at how each term relates to the previous one. Observe:
- From 2 to 4: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
- From 4 to 8: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
You are asked to:
1. **Plot points** on a coordinate grid.
2. **Identify the constant of proportionality**.

The given points are:
- (2, 4)
- (3, 6)
- (4, 8)
- (5, 10)

These points represent ordered pairs $(x, y)$, where $x$ is the input and $y$ is the output.

---

### Step 2: Plot the Points
1. Draw a coordinate grid with the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical).
2. Label the axes with appropriate scales. For example:
   - The x-axis could be labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
   - The y-axis could be labeled similarly.
3. Plot each point:
   - Start at the origin (0, 0).
   - For (2, 4), move 2 units to the right along the x-axis and 4 units up along the y-axis.
   - Repeat for the other points: (3, 6), (4, 8), and (5, 10).

When you plot these points, you will notice they form a straight line passing through the origin (0, 0). This indicates that the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is proportional.

---

### Step 3: Identify the Constant of Proportionality
A proportional relationship can be expressed as:
$$
y = kx
$$
where $k$ is the constant of proportionality.

To find $k$, use any of the given points and calculate:
$$
k = \frac{y}{x}
$$

Let’s calculate $k$ using the first point (2, 4):
$$
k = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
$$

Verify this value of $k$ with the other points:
- For (3, 6): $k = \frac{6}{3} = 2$
- For (4, 8): $k = \frac{8}{4} = 2$
- For (5, 10): $k = \frac{10}{5} = 2$

Since $k$ is consistent across all points, the constant of proportionality is:
$$
\boxed{2}
$$

---

### Step 4: Interpret the Result
The constant of proportionality ($k = 2$) means that for every unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases by 2. The equation of the line representing this relationship is:
$$
y = 2x

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem
The recipe states that **4 cups of flour are needed to make 8 cookies**. This means there is a proportional relationship between the amount of flour (in cups) and the number of cookies produced. In a proportional relationship, the ratio between two quantities remains constant.

We are tasked with:
1. Graphing the points \((8, 4)\) and \((16, 8)\), where the first coordinate represents the number of cookies (\(x\)) and the second coordinate represents the cups of flour (\(y\)).
2. Finding the **constant of proportionality**, which is the ratio \(y/x\) (cups of flour per cookie).

---

### Step 2: Plot the points
The given points are:
- \((8, 4)\): This means 8 cookies require 4 cups of flour.
- \((16, 8)\): This means 16 cookies require 8 cups of flour.

On a graph:
- The horizontal axis (\(x\)-axis) represents the number of cookies.
- The vertical axis (\(y\)-axis) represents the cups of flour.

Plot the points \((8, 4)\) and \((16, 8)\). These points will lie on a straight line passing through the origin \((0, 0)\), because the relationship is proportional.

---

### Step 3: Find the constant of proportionality
The constant of proportionality (\(k\)) is the ratio of \(y\) (cups of flour) to \(x\) (number of cookies). It can be calculated using either of the given points:

#### Using \((8, 4)\):
\[
k = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5
\]

#### Using \((16, 8)\):
\[
k = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{8}{16} = 0.5
\]

Thus, the constant of proportionality is \(k = 0.5\). This means **each cookie requires 0.5 cups of flour**.

---

### Step 4: Write the equation of the line
In a proportional relationship, the equation relating \(y\) (cups of flour) and \(x\) (number of cookies) is:
\[
y = kx
\]
Substitute \(k = 0.5\):
\[
y = 0.5x
\]

This equation tells us how many cups of flour (\(y\)) are needed for any number of cookies (\(x\)).

Then, you'll plot these points on a coordinate grid. Let’s break this into clear steps:

---

### Step 1: Understand Proportionality
A proportional relationship is a linear relationship where the ratio of \(y\) to \(x\) is constant. This means the equation can be written in the form:
\[
y = kx
\]
where \(k\) is the constant of proportionality.

---

### Step 2: Determine the Constant of Proportionality (\(k\))
Using one of the given points, substitute \(x\) and \(y\) into the equation \(y = kx\) to solve for \(k\).

Let’s use the point \((1, 2)\):
\[
y = kx \implies 2 = k(1) \implies k = 2
\]

To confirm that \(k = 2\) works for all points, check the other points:
- For \((2, 4)\): \(y = kx \implies 4 = 2(2) \implies 4 = 4\) (True)
- For \((3, 6)\): \(y = kx \implies 6 = 2(3) \implies 6 = 6\) (True)

Thus, the constant of proportionality is \(k = 2\).

---

Now that we know \(k = 2\), the proportional equation is:
\[
y = 2x
\]

---

### Step 4: Plot the Points on a Coordinate Grid
To visualize the relationship, follow these steps:
1. Draw a coordinate grid with the \(x\)-axis (horizontal) and \(y\)-axis (vertical).
2. Mark the points \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((3, 6)\) on the grid.
   - For \((1, 2)\), move 1 unit to the right from the origin and 2 units up.
   - For \((2, 4)\), move 2 units to the right and 4 units up.
   - For \((3, 6)\), move 3 units to the right and 6 units up.
3. Connect the points with a straight line. Since the relationship is proportional, the line should pass through the origin \((0, 0)\).

---

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between total cost and number of t-shirts
The total cost of the t-shirts is calculated by multiplying the price per t-shirt by the number of t-shirts purchased:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Price per T-shirt} \times \text{Number of T-shirts}
\]

In this case:
- The **price per t-shirt** is $15.
- The **total cost** is $120.

We need to find the **number of t-shirts**, which we'll call \( x \).

---

### Step 2: Set up the equation
Using the formula above, substitute the known values:
\[
120 = 15 \times x
\]

Here, \( x \) represents the number of t-shirts.

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- You currently have $200 saved.
- The bike costs **$50 more than what you currently have**.
- We are tasked with finding out how much money you originally had.

### Step 2: Define variables
Let’s define:
- \( x \): the amount of money you originally had.

### Step 3: Express the cost of the bike
The bike costs $50 more than what you currently have. Since you currently have $200, the cost of the bike is:
\[
200 + 50 = 250
\]

Thus, the bike costs $250.

### Step 4: Relate the original amount to the current amount
If \( x \) represents the amount of money you originally had, and you saved up to reach $200, then:
\[
x + \text{(amount saved)} = 200
\]

Since the problem doesn't specify how much you saved beyond the original amount, we assume that the ""original amount"" \( x \) is simply the starting point before saving anything. Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
x = 200 - \text{(amount saved)}
\]

However, since no additional saving details are provided, we conclude that \( x \) is simply the amount you started with.

- The first term (\(a_1\)) is $15.
- The common difference (\(d\)) is \(-2\) (because the price decreases by $2).

The formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
\]
where:
- \(a_n\) is the price of the \(n\)-th book,
- \(a_1\) is the price of the first book,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the position of the book in the sequence.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Prices of the Next Three Books
We already know the price of the first book (\(a_1 = 15\)). Now, let’s calculate the prices of the next three books (\(a_2\), \(a_3\), and \(a_4\)):

#### For the second book (\(a_2\)):
\[
a_2 = a_1 + (2-1) \cdot d = 15 + 1 \cdot (-2) = 15 - 2 = 13
\]

#### For the third book (\(a_3\)):
\[
a_3 = a_1 + (3-1) \cdot d = 15 + 2 \cdot (-2) = 15 - 4 = 11
\]

#### For the fourth book (\(a_4\)):
\[
a_4 = a_1 + (4-1) \cdot d = 15 + 3 \cdot (-2) = 15 - 6 = 9
\]

---

### Step 4: Present the Results
The prices of the next three books in the sequence are:
- Second book: $13
- Third book: $11
- Fourth book: $9

Thus, the prices of the next three books are **$13, $11, and $9**.

---

### Final Answer:

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Other functional relationships","F","In a gardening club members plant 3 new trees in the first week and increase their planting by 2 trees each subsequent week; calculate the number of trees planted in the next 4 weeks.","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. The task involves calculating the number of trees planted in the next 4 weeks based on the given pattern.

### Step 1: Understand the Pattern
- In the **first week**, members plant **3 trees**.
- Each subsequent week, they increase the number of trees planted by **2 more trees** than the previous week.

This means the number of trees planted each week follows an arithmetic sequence:
- Week 1: \( 3 \) trees
- Week 2: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) trees
- Week 3: \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) trees
- Week 4: \( 7 + 2 = 9 \) trees
- And so on...

The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d
\]
where:
- \( a_1 \) is the first term (\( 3 \) in this case),
- \( d \) is the common difference (\( 2 \) in this case),
- \( n \) is the term number.

### Step 2: Calculate Trees Planted in the Next 4 Weeks
We are tasked with finding the number of trees planted in the next 4 weeks. These correspond to **Weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5**.

#### Week 2:
Using the formula:
\[
a_2 = a_1 + (2 - 1)d = 3 + 1(2) = 5
\]
So, **5 trees** are planted in Week 2.

#### Week 3:
\[
a_3 = a_1 + (3 - 1)d = 3 + 2(2) = 7
\]
So, **7 trees** are planted in Week 3.

#### Week 4:
\[
a_4 = a_1 + (4 - 1)d = 3 + 3(2) = 9
\]
So, **9 trees** are planted in Week 4.

#### Week 5:
\[
a_5 = a_1 + (5 - 1)d = 3 + 4(2) = 11
\]
So, **11 trees** are planted in Week 5.

The total number of trees planted in the next 4 weeks is **32**."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Other functional relationships","G","Identify the common ratio in the geometric sequence 3 6 12 24 and use it to predict the next two terms.","To solve this task, we need to identify the **common ratio** in the given geometric sequence and use it to predict the next two terms. Let’s break this down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand what a geometric sequence is
A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the **common ratio**.

For example, in the sequence \(3, 6, 12, 24\), each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by the same number (the common ratio).

---

### Step 2: Find the common ratio
The common ratio (\(r\)) can be calculated by dividing any term in the sequence by the term that precedes it. For the given sequence \(3, 6, 12, 24\):

- \( r = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \)
- \( r = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \)
- \( r = \frac{24}{12} = 2 \)

Thus, the **common ratio** is \( r = 2 \).

---

### Step 3: Predict the next two terms
To find the next terms in the sequence, multiply the last known term by the common ratio (\(r = 2\)):

1. The fifth term:
   \[
   24 \times 2 = 48
   \]

2. The sixth term:
   \[
   48 \times 2 = 96
   \]

---

### Final Answer:
The next two terms in the sequence are **48** and **96**.

So, the complete sequence becomes:
\[

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Other functional relationships","G","A car's value decreases by half each year; if its current value is $16000 what will the value be after 3 years in a geometric sequence?","To solve this problem, we need to understand how the car's value decreases over time in a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence is one where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. In this case, the car's value decreases by half each year, so the common ratio \( r \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Identify the given information:
- Initial value of the car (\( a \)): $16,000
- Common ratio (\( r \)): \( \frac{1}{2} \) (since the value decreases by half each year)
- Number of years (\( n \)): 3

The formula for the \( n \)-th term of a geometric sequence is:

\[
a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
\]

However, since the car's value decreases at the end of each year, we can directly use:

\[
\text{Value after } n \text{ years} = a \cdot r^n
\]

#### 2. Plug in the values:
We want to find the value of the car after 3 years (\( n = 3 \)).

\[
\text{Value after 3 years} = 16000 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
\]

#### 3. Simplify the expression:
First, calculate \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Now multiply this result by the initial value:

\[
\text{Value after 3 years} = 16000 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{16000}{8} = 2000
\]

#### 4. Final Answer:
The value of the car after 3 years will be **\$2000**.

### Summary:
The car's value decreases geometrically by a factor of \( \frac{1}{2} \) each year. Using the formula for the \( n \)-th term of a geometric sequence, we calculated that the car's value after 3 years is **\$2000**."

The general formula for the \( n \)-th term (\( T_n \)) of a geometric sequence is:

\[
T_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
\]

Where:
- \( a \) is the first term of the sequence,

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between cookies and flour
The recipe tells us that **12 cookies require 3 cups of flour**. This means the amount of flour needed is proportional to the number of cookies being made.

We can calculate the amount of flour needed per cookie by dividing the total amount of flour by the number of cookies:
\[
\text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{\text{Total flour}}{\text{Number of cookies}} = \frac{3 \, \text{cups}}{12 \, \text{cookies}} = 0.25 \, \text{cups per cookie}.
\]

So, each cookie requires **0.25 cups of flour**.

---

### Step 2: Scale up to 30 cookies
Now that we know each cookie requires 0.25 cups of flour, we can calculate the total amount of flour needed for 30 cookies by multiplying the flour per cookie by the number of cookies:
\[
\text{Flour for 30 cookies} = \text{Flour per cookie} \times \text{Number of cookies} = 0.25 \, \text{cups} \times 30 = 7.5 \, \text{cups}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Final Answer
Therefore, **7.5 cups of flour** are needed to make 30 cookies.

---

### Optional Check (Proportional Reasoning)
Another way to solve this problem is by setting up a proportion:
\[
\frac{\text{Flour for 12 cookies}}{\text{12 cookies}} = \frac{\text{Flour for 30 cookies}}{\text{30 cookies}}.
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{3}{12} = \frac{x}{30},
\]
where \(x\) is the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies. Cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):
\[
12x = 3 \times 30,
\]
\[
12x = 90,
\]
\[
x = \frac{90}{12} = 7.5.
\]

This confirms that **7.5 cups of flour** are needed for 30 cookies.

---

By either method, the answer is the same: **7.5 cups of flour**."

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the car's fuel efficiency.
The car travels **240 miles** using **8 gallons** of gas. To find the car's fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon), divide the distance traveled by the amount of gas used:

\[
\text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Gas used}} = \frac{240 \, \text{miles}}{8 \, \text{gallons}} = 30 \, \text{miles per gallon}.
\]

So, the car gets **30 miles per gallon**.

---

### Step 2: Determine the amount of gas needed for 600 miles.
Now that we know the car travels 30 miles per gallon, we can calculate how many gallons are needed to travel 600 miles. Use the formula:

\[
\text{Gallons needed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Fuel efficiency}} = \frac{600 \, \text{miles}}{30 \, \text{miles per gallon}} = 20 \, \text{gallons}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The car will need **20 gallons** of gas to travel 600 miles.

---

### Summary of the Process:
1. Find the car's fuel efficiency by dividing the distance traveled by the gas used.
2. Use the fuel efficiency to calculate the gas required for the new distance by dividing the new distance by the fuel efficiency.

This method ensures you can solve similar problems involving proportional relationships between distance and fuel consumption."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Assignments and proportionality","H","A painter can complete a mural in 15 hours; if they work at the same rate how long will it take to finish 4 murals?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the rate of work
The painter can complete **1 mural in 15 hours**. This means their work rate is:

\[
\text{Rate of work} = \frac{\text{1 mural}}{\text{15 hours}}
\]

This tells us how much of a mural the painter can complete in one hour.

### Step 2: Determine the total amount of work needed
The task now is to paint **4 murals**. So, the total amount of work required is:

\[
\text{Total work} = 4 \, \text{murals}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time required
Since the painter works at a constant rate of \(\frac{1}{15}\) murals per hour, we can calculate the total time required to complete 4 murals by dividing the total work (4 murals) by the painter's rate of work (\(\frac{1}{15}\) murals per hour):

\[
\text{Time required} = \frac{\text{Total work}}{\text{Rate of work}} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{15}}
\]

Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal, so:

\[
\text{Time required} = 4 \times 15 = 60 \, \text{hours}
\]

### Final Answer:
It will take the painter **60 hours** to complete 4 murals if they work at the same rate.

---

### Alternative Explanation:
You can also think about it this way: If it takes 15 hours to paint 1 mural, then for 4 murals, the painter would need:

\[
15 \, \text{hours/mural} \times 4 \, \text{murals} = 60 \, \text{hours}
\]

Let's break it down:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Linear Function
The equation \( y = 3x + 2 \) is in slope-intercept form, \( y = mx + b \), where:
- \( m = 3 \) is the slope (rate of change),
- \( b = 2 \) is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis).

This means that for every increase of 1 in \( x \), \( y \) increases by 3.

---

### Step 2: Create a Table of Values
We are given \( x \)-values ranging from -2 to 2. For each \( x \)-value, substitute it into the equation \( y = 3x + 2 \) to calculate the corresponding \( y \)-value.

| \( x \) | Calculation (\( y = 3x + 2 \)) | \( y \) |

| 0       | \( y = 3(0) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2 \)   | 2      |
| 1       | \( y = 3(1) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \)   | 5      |
| 2       | \( y = 3(2) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \)   | 8      |

Now that we have the table of values, plot the points \((-2, -4)\), \((-1, -1)\), \((0, 2)\), \((1, 5)\), and \((2, 8)\) on a coordinate plane.

1. Draw a Cartesian coordinate system with the \( x \)-axis (horizontal) and \( y \)-axis (vertical).
2. Mark the points from the table:
   - At \( (-2, -4) \): Move 2 units left and 4 units down.
   - At \( (-1, -1) \): Move 1 unit left and 1 unit down.
   - At \( (0, 2) \): Stay at the origin horizontally and move 2 units up.
   - At \( (1, 5) \): Move 1 unit right and 5 units up.
   - At \( (2, 8) \): Move 2 units right and 8 units up.
3. Connect the points with a straight line, as the function \( y = 3x + 2 \) represents a linear relationship.

---

### Step 4: Verify the Graph
Ensure that the line passes through all the plotted points and extends infinitely in both directions. The line should have a positive slope because \( m = 3 > 0 \), meaning it rises as \( x \) increases.

---

### **Step 1: Write the Linear Equation**
The problem states that muffins cost $2 each. Let \(x\) represent the number of muffins purchased, and \(y\) represent the total cost in dollars. Since each muffin costs $2, the total cost \(y\) is simply the product of the price per muffin (\$2) and the number of muffins (\(x\)).

Thus, the linear equation is:
\[
y = 2x
\]

This equation represents the relationship between the number of muffins purchased (\(x\)) and the total cost (\(y\)).

---

### **Step 2: Generate Values for \(x\) from 0 to 4**
To graph the equation, we need to calculate corresponding \(y\)-values for given \(x\)-values. We will substitute \(x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\) into the equation \(y = 2x\) and compute the resulting \(y\)-values.

#### Calculation:

  y = 2(0) = 0
  \]
- When \(x = 1\):  
  \[
  y = 2(1) = 2

  \[
  y = 2(2) = 4
  \]
- When \(x = 3\):  
  \[
  y = 2(3) = 6
  \]
- When \(x = 4\):  
  \[
  y = 2(4) = 8
  \]

#### Table of Values:
We can summarize these results in a table:

| \(x\) (Number of Muffins) | \(y\) (Total Cost in Dollars) |

---

### **Step 3: Graph the Equation**
Using the table above, you can plot the points \((x, y)\) on a coordinate plane:
- Plot the points: \((0, 0)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 6)\), and \((4, 8)\).
- Draw a straight line through these points, as the equation \(y = 2x\) represents a linear relationship.

1. Draw a Cartesian coordinate system with the horizontal axis (\( x \)-axis) representing Celsius (\( C \)) and the vertical axis (\( y \)-axis) representing Fahrenheit (\( F \)).
2. Mark the points from the table on the graph:
   - \( (0, 32) \)
   - \( (10, 122) \)
   - \( (20, 212) \)
   - \( (30, 302) \)
3. Connect the points with a straight line, as the relationship between \( F \) and \( C \) is linear (based on the formula \( F = 9C + 32 \)).

---

### Final Answer
The table of values is:

| Celsius (\( C \)) | Fahrenheit (\( F \)) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| 0                   | 32                     |
| 10                  | 122                    |
| 20                  | 212                    |
| 30                  | 302                    |

And the plotted graph will show a straight line passing through the points \( (0, 32) \), \( (10, 122) \), \( (20, 212) \), and \( (30, 302) \).

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Equations and algebra","F","Solve for x: 3(x - 4) = 2(x + 5).","To solve the equation \( 3(x - 4) = 2(x + 5) \), you'll want to isolate \( x \). Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to do that:

---

### Step 1: Expand both sides of the equation
Start by distributing (or expanding) the terms on both sides of the equation.

On the left-hand side:
\[
3(x - 4) = 3x - 12
\]

On the right-hand side:
\[
2(x + 5) = 2x + 10
\]

So, the equation becomes:
\[
3x - 12 = 2x + 10
\]

---

### Step 2: Collect all \( x \)-terms on one side
To simplify, subtract \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to move all \( x \)-terms to the left-hand side:
\[
3x - 2x - 12 = 10
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
x - 12 = 10
\]

---

### Step 3: Collect constant terms on the other side
Now, add 12 to both sides of the equation to move the constant term (\(-12\)) to the right-hand side:
\[
x = 10 + 12
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
x = 22
\]

---

### Step 4: Verify the solution
To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 22 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Original equation:
\[
3(x - 4) = 2(x + 5)
\]

Substitute \( x = 22 \):
\[
3(22 - 4) = 2(22 + 5)
\]

Simplify both sides:
\[
3(18) = 2(27)
\]
\[
54 = 54
\]

Since both sides are equal, the solution is correct.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{x = 22}

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Equations and algebra","F","A school is planning a fundraiser; if the items cost $12 each and the total cost is equal to 4 times the number of items sold solve for y in the equation 12y = 4y + 48.","To solve the given equation \( 12y = 4y + 48 \), let's break it down step by step and understand the process clearly.

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem
The equation \( 12y = 4y + 48 \) represents the relationship between the cost of items sold and the total cost. Here:
- \( y \) is the number of items sold.
- The left-hand side, \( 12y \), represents the total revenue from selling \( y \) items at $12 each.
- The right-hand side, \( 4y + 48 \), represents the total cost, which is equal to 4 times the number of items sold (\( 4y \)) plus a fixed cost of $48.

Our goal is to solve for \( y \), the number of items sold.

---

### Step 2: Simplify the equation
We start with the equation:
\[
12y = 4y + 48
\]

#### Subtract \( 4y \) from both sides:
This eliminates \( 4y \) from the right-hand side:
\[
12y - 4y = 48
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
8y = 48
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( y \)
To isolate \( y \), divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[
y = \frac{48}{8}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
y = 6
\]

---

### Step 4: Verify the solution
To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( y = 6 \) back into the original equation:

Original equation:
\[
12y = 4y + 48
\]

Substitute \( y = 6 \):
\[
12(6) = 4(6) + 48
\]

Simplify both sides:
\[
72 = 24 + 48
\]

\[
72 = 72
\]

Since both sides are equal, the solution is correct.

---

### Final Answer:
The number of items sold is \( \boxed{6} \)."

Let's break this problem down step by step and solve it clearly.

### Problem Restatement:
Jamie has twice as many apples as Alex, and together they have 36 apples. We need to determine how many apples Alex has.

### Step 1: Define the variables
Let \( x \) represent the number of apples Alex has. Since Jamie has **twice as many apples as Alex**, Jamie will have \( 2x \) apples.

### Step 2: Write the equation
Together, Alex and Jamie have 36 apples. This means the total number of apples Alex and Jamie have combined is:
\[
x + 2x = 36
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms on the left-hand side:
\[
3x = 36
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
To isolate \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
x = \frac{36}{3}
\]
\[
x = 12
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result
Since \( x \) represents the number of apples Alex has, Alex has **12 apples**. 

Additionally, since Jamie has twice as many apples as Alex, Jamie has:
\[
2x = 2(12) = 24 \text{ apples}.
\]

### Step 6: Verify the solution
Check that the total number of apples adds up to 36:
\[
12 + 24 = 36
\]
The solution is correct!

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Recognizing patterns and structures","G","A bakery produces 10 loaves of bread on the first day and increases production by 5 loaves each subsequent day; express the total number of loaves produced on day \( n \) as an algebraic formula and use it to find the number produced on day 7.","To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. The bakery's production increases daily in an arithmetic sequence, where the first term is 10 loaves and each subsequent day adds 5 more loaves than the previous day.

### Step 1: Identify the pattern
The bakery produces:
- On Day 1: $ 10 $ loaves
- On Day 2: $ 10 + 5 = 15 $ loaves
- On Day 3: $ 15 + 5 = 20 $ loaves
- On Day 4: $ 20 + 5 = 25 $ loaves

This forms an arithmetic sequence with:
- First term ($ a $) = $ 10 $
- Common difference ($ d $) = $ 5 $

### Step 2: General formula for the $ n $-th term of an arithmetic sequence
The general formula for the $ n $-th term ($ T_n $) of an arithmetic sequence is:

$$
T_n = a + (n - 1)d
$$

Substitute $ a = 10 $ and $ d = 5 $ into the formula:

$$
T_n = 10 + (n - 1) \cdot 5
$$

Simplify the expression:

$$
T_n = 10 + 5n - 5
$$

$$
T_n = 5n + 5
$$

Thus, the number of loaves produced on day $ n $ is given by:

$$
T_n = 5n + 5
$$

### Step 3: Find the number of loaves produced on day 7
To find the number of loaves produced on day 7, substitute $ n = 7 $ into the formula:

$$
T_7 = 5(7) + 5
$$

$$
T_7 = 35 + 5
$$

$$
T_7 = 40
$$

### Final Answer:
The total number of loaves produced on day 7 is $\boxed{40}$."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Recognizing patterns and structures","G","The cost of a monthly gym membership starts at $20 and increases by $5 for each additional family member; write an algebraic expression for the total cost based on the number of members and calculate the cost for a family of 4.","To solve this task, we need to break it down into two parts: writing an algebraic expression for the total cost of a gym membership based on the number of family members and then calculating the cost for a specific family size (in this case, 4 members).

---

### **Step 1: Write the Algebraic Expression**
We are told:
- The base cost of the gym membership is **$20**.
- For each additional family member, the cost increases by **$5**.

Let \( n \) represent the number of family members. The total cost (\( C \)) can be expressed as:

\[
C = 20 + 5(n - 1)
\]

Here's why:
- The first family member pays the base cost of $20.
- Each additional family member adds $5 to the cost. Since the first member doesn't count as ""additional,"" we subtract 1 from \( n \) before multiplying by $5.

Simplify the expression:
\[
C = 20 + 5n - 5
\]
\[
C = 15 + 5n
\]

So, the algebraic expression for the total cost is:
\[
C = 15 + 5n
\]

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the Cost for a Family of 4**
Now that we have the expression \( C = 15 + 5n \), substitute \( n = 4 \) (since the family has 4 members):

\[
C = 15 + 5(4)
\]
\[
C = 15 + 20
\]
\[
C = 35
\]

---

### **Final Answer**
The total cost for a family of 4 is **\$35**.

---

### **Summary**
1. The algebraic expression for the total cost is \( C = 15 + 5n \).
2. For a family of 4 members, the total cost is **\$35**."
"Functional relationships (patterns and structures)","Recognizing patterns and structures","G","A car rental company charges a base fee of $30 plus $15 for each day the car is rented; create an algebraic formula for the total cost in terms of the number of days \( d \) the car is rented and determine the cost for renting the car for 3 days.","To solve this task, let's break it into clear steps:

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem
The car rental company charges:
- A **base fee** of $30.
- An additional **$15 per day** for renting the car.

We are tasked with:
1. Creating an **algebraic formula** for the total cost in terms of the number of days \( d \) the car is rented.
2. Calculating the total cost for renting the car for **3 days**.

---

### Step 2: Create the algebraic formula
The total cost (\( C \)) consists of:
- The base fee of $30 (a fixed amount).
- The daily charge of $15 multiplied by the number of days \( d \).

Thus, the total cost can be expressed as:
\[
C = 30 + 15d
\]
where:
- \( C \) is the total cost in dollars.
- \( d \) is the number of days the car is rented.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for 3 days
Now substitute \( d = 3 \) into the formula \( C = 30 + 15d \):

\[
C = 30 + 15(3)
\]

First, calculate \( 15(3) \):
\[
15(3) = 45
\]

Then add the base fee:
\[
C = 30 + 45 = 75
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The total cost for renting the car for 3 days is:
\[
\boxed{75 \text{ dollars}}
\] 

This approach ensures that we have both created the correct algebraic formula and applied it accurately to find the specific cost for 3 days."
