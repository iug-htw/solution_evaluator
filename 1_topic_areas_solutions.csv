    - Mark these positions clearly, using a dot or an 'X' to indicate the specific locations of your negative numbers.

5. **Label Points (Optional)**:
    - Label each plotted point with its corresponding negative number for clarity.

Here’s a simple example:

If you need to plot -2, -5, and -3, your number line will have labeled points like:

```
    -5   -4   -3   -2   -1   0   1   2   3
    --------------------------------------
         X              X   X
```
